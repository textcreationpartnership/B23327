            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE.</head>
            <p>THough you neither buy nor read this Book but for your pleaſure, yet, if it afford you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, you may juſtly complain both of your loſs of time and money, but I can aſſure you, it was not writ to delight alone, but chiefly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct: As ſome Phyſicians purge with agreeable Potions, ſo ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Books give profitable Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements. Experience hath taught us the uſeleſsneſs of Dogmatick Morals, and let good Maxims be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo often inculcated, they are
<pb facs="tcp:108350:3"/> obſerved with no leſs difficulty, than attended to with impatience: but when we ſee Vice made ridiculous, we amend, leaſt we become objects of publick deriſion. The greateſt imputation againſt the Preſent I now make you, is, that it treats only of trifles, and directs in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſlighteſt conſideration. But let us recollect how many preach great Vertues and decry great Vices, and how few reprehend ordinary defects, by how much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, by ſo much more dangerous, ſince becoming habitual, we ſcarce ever take notice of them. Do we not daily meet infinite numbers of fantaſtick brains? impertinent, covetous, and cavelling, he and ſhe buſie-bodies; yet who minds them of their follies, unleſs Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Satyr, which leaving to Divines and Magiſtrates the care
<pb facs="tcp:108350:3"/> of oppoſing crimes, employ themſelves in correcting what is indecent and ridiculous; and theſe are no leſs neceſſary, and often more profitable, than all the other ſerious diſcourſes. For, as many stand in no need of Profeſſors of Philoſophy that cannot be brought up without School-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſo we rather want Cenſors of ſmall faults, to which we all are ſubject, then of thoſe great ones to which only the corrupteſt are liable. The pleaſure we take in rallying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, makes us ſwallow with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ſuch Phyſick as is wholſom to our ſelves; to which purpoſe Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Characters ought to be ſo ſuited to our Cuſtoms, that, we may believe, we diſcern in them the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we daily frequent. And, as an excellent Picture cauſes our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, though we have none for the perſon it repreſents; ſo, Fables
<pb facs="tcp:108350:4"/> well written and under borrowed Titles, make greater impreſsion on us than true Names and real Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures: for, he that in preſence of a crooked man fains to be crooked, gives him greater ſenſe of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then than the ſight of another that hath indeed the ſame deformity; and, the Story of <hi>Lucrece</hi> which you will find in this Book, hath, as I am credibly informed, cured a conſiderable Maid of this Town of her love to a Lord, whoſe events in all probability muſt have been like the other.</p>
            <p>All the favour I deſire is (ſince I have been ſo careful to acquaint you there is not any thing here but what is fabulous) that you do not vainly enquire after the perſon whoſe Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait or Hiſtory you imagine you have found out, to apply it to ſuch a Gentleman, or ſuch a Lady, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:108350:4"/> pretence of reſemblance of Name or Character. I am ſenſible enough that reading this Romance, your firſt buſineſs will be to ſeek a Key, which yet the mixture of the wards will render uſeleſs; and when you ſuppoſe you ſee the Picture of one, you will find the Adventures of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. A Painter that draws Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, guided only by his fancy, ſhall accidentally give ſome of them Airs not unknown to us, though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes only imaginary <hi>Hero's;</hi> and you, when you diſcover in theſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures the reſemblances of ſome of your acquaintance, will be too raſh, if you cry out this is he; rather be careful (here being <hi>Idea's</hi> of many Fools) that you lite not on your own Effigies.</p>

            <head>THE CITY ROMANCE.</head>
            <p>I Sing the Amours and Adventures of certain Citizens of <hi>Paris</hi> of both Sexes, and though it may ſeem ſtrange that I ſing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Skill in Muſick; yet <hi>Romances</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poems in Proſe, I ſhould do ill by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Exordium</hi> to deviate from the examples of my Maſters. For ſince old <hi>Virgil</hi> ſung <hi>Aeneas</hi> and his Arms, and <hi>Taſſo</hi> of Poetical Memory diſtinguiſhed his Work into <hi>Canto's,</hi> their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors (not a jot better Muſicians than my ſelf) have ſtill repeated the ſame Tune, and begun with the ſame Note. But I will extend my imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation no farther, nor fall to invoke the Muſes,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108350:6"/> as all Poets uſe at the beginning of their Work, thinking it ſo neceſſary that they adventure not on the leaſt Sonnet without a Prayer, to which their Deities are but ſeldom propitious. I will omit many other Poetical circumſtances, and not flea the Eel by beginning at the Tail; like thoſe that think to excel and ſurpriſe by ſuch a repreſenting an adventure. This uſually enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them in a confuſion, that ends not till ſome charitable Squire or Waiting Gentlewoman comes to illuſtrate what hath paſſed, by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery or ſurpriſal of what tends to underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of deceiving you by ſuch vain ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I will honeſtly and plainly tell you ſome little Tales or Gallantries happened amongſt Perſons that are neither Hero's nor Heroines, that neither defeat Armies nor ſubdue King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, but being honeſt People of an ordinary condition, fairly jogge on the High-way. Some of them ſhall be handſom, others ill-favoured, ſome wiſe, others fooliſh, and of theſe I think the greater number: Notwithſtanding which ſuch as conceive they are better qualified, may in them contemplate themſelves, and profit by examples of follies from which they judge they are the moſt remote. To avoid the over-worn paths which others have beaten, the Scene of my Romance ſhall be moveable, ſometimes in one Quarter of the Town, ſometimes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I will begin with that which hath moſt of the City commonly called <hi>Place Maubert.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:108350:6"/>
            <p>An Author leſs faithful and more deſirous to appear eloquent would be very loath to omit a magnificent deſcription of this place. His <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comium</hi> ſhould begin with its Name's Original, telling you it was made famous by that renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctor <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> who taught there; that of old it was called, <hi>The Place of Maſter Albert,</hi> and by corruption of time, <hi>Place Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert;</hi> and if he occaſionally writ the Life of its renown'd Godfather, he was not the firſt that made a digreſſion as far from the purpoſe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this it ſhould be ſtately built, more or leſs, according to the expence his fancy reſolv'd on: the deſign of the Place Royal would not at all ſatisfie him, and it muſt be at leaſt as fair as that where the Carrowſels had wont to be made in the Gallant and Romantick City of <hi>Grenada.</hi> Do not imagine he would deſcribe it as really it is, a Triangular Place, encompaſt with mean houſes for reception of Tradeſmen, he would hang himſelf but he would make it a Square, and turn all the Stalls into Galleries or Porches, the Windows into Balconies, and Poſts into Marble Pillars. But when he came to deſcribe the Carmelites Church, Architecture ſhould freely diſplay it ſelf, perhaps not a little to its prejudice, He would preſent you a Temple beautiful as <hi>Diana</hi>'s of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſupported by 100 Corinthian Pillars, fill all the Niches with Statues made by <hi>Phidias</hi> or <hi>Praxiteles,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn them with Hiſtories in Emboſſed Figures. The Altar ſhould be Jaſper or Porphyry, and if it came in his head the whole Edifice; for in the

This makes Authors ſo itch after ſuch Deſcriptions, that they omit no occaſion of making them, nay drag them in headlong, and to lodge ſome Vagabond or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, that carries all he is worth about him, build a Pallace fairer than the <hi>Louvre</hi> or <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thanks to my ſincerity I am without any care of this, and though all theſe things might with little charge be afforded to ſet out the Stage, had rather preſent you this piece without pomp or ſplendor, and as was uſual of old with a ſimple Tapiſtry for all Ornament; ſo that I will not ſo much as give you the faſhion of the Church, though conſiderable enough, but leave ſuch as know it not, to go at their pleaſure to view it, or elſe build it in their imagination in ſuch a manner as beſt likes them. All that I think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to acquaint you with, is that it is the Center of the City Gallantry, and very much frequented, becauſe of the liberty allowed there. Hither about Noon come Bevies of Ladies, whoſe Mothers within ten years wore Chaperons, the certain Mark and diſtinction of Citizens; but theſe they have gradually ſo often pared, they are at laſt vaniſhed. I ſhall not need to tell you there come alſo Gallants of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108350:7"/> the ſame ſtamp, the conſequence is too natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; every one hath her Train of theſe, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or leſſer according as her Beauty or Fortune is attractive.</p>
            <p>One ſolemn Holyday this Aſſembly was more numerous then uſually, and beſides the Devout, Lovers of Muſick were invited by a conſent of 24 Violins: others flocked to hear an Eloquent Preacher. This was an Abbot without any Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, that is, a Son of a good Family in Orders, one of which commonly carries that Title.</p>
            <p>His Surplice was laced, neatly folded and ſtarched, his Beard turned up with Irons, his Hair very much frizled to appear the ſhorter, and he affected a kind of liſping, that his Tone might be more taking. He thought the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Sermon was to be valued by the Price of the Pews, and he uſed all poſſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to invite Auditory, ſuch eſpecially as would come in Coaches. He ſent to all his Acquaintance to deſire their preſence, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed Tickets like the Players.</p>
            <p>A fair Maid who was that day to be Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctreſs for the Poor, attracted many, and all Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants that pretended to her favor, flocked thither expreſly to preſent her ſome conſiderable piece; this manner of Collecting being the touch-ſtone of Maids Beauties and Mens Affections: He that preſents moſt is thought to love moſt, and She that collects the greateſt Sum is held the faireſt; in ſo much that as formerly Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men juſtified their Miſtriſſes Beauty with the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108350:8"/> Lance in Reſt againſt all Oppoſers; ſo in later times the City proof is for the Miſtriſs to appear with a Baſon in her hand againſt all Rivals.</p>
            <p>The Collectreſs was indeed fair, and had ſhe not been City born and bred, might have been very agreeable to a Man of Quality. Expect not yet that I give you her deſcription, as is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual on ſuch occaſions, for when I have told you ſhe was tall and ſlender, quick and rolling Eyes, flaxen Hair, naturally curled, and many other particulars of her Perſon, you will not for all that know her; nor that ſhe was perfectly beautiful: for ſhe might have had Warts, Puſhes, or Pockholes, witneſs many Hero's and Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines handſom in Paper and masked in a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, that are very ill-favored in fleſh and blood. I could with greater eaſe have acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelf of this, by giving you her Picture at the beginning of the Book, if the Stationer would have been at the charge, and it would have been no leſs neceſſary than the Figures of Battels, Temples, and Navies, that ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to raiſe the price of Books; yet I blame them not, leſt I be taxed to reprehend that which is moſt valuable in our Modern Authors.</p>
            <p>I return to my fair Collectreſs, and for her ſake paſs by (at leaſt till a fitter opportunity) all ſuch other Adventures as that day happened in the great Aſſembly of ſuch as were liſted under the Standard of Gallantry. This Maid was then in all her glory, bedecked to the utmoſt poſſibility, her Head dreſſed by a Waiting-Gentlewoman
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108350:8"/> of the Neighbourhood, that had immediately learned of one that belonged to the Court. She had not only borrowed Jewels but a Lackey alſo that carried up her Train; and though this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded her quality, ſhe was glad to make uſe of the occaſion, to ſatisfie her vanity; nothing being liable to exception that is done to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the Church and Charity: ſhe was led by her Fathers Head-Clerk, as well for neceſſity as Oſtentation; for how could ſhe otherwiſe have traverſed the Church on Chairs and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? at leaſt without the activity of a Rope-Dancer.</p>
            <p>All theſe Advantages tended well to the Churches profit, but before I leave her, I muſt needs acquaint you ſhe was very young, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſſential to the Hiſtory, as alſo that ſhe had much of innocence, good nature, or ſimplicity; which of theſe 3 excellent Qualities it was, I ſhall not point out, your ſelves may judge by the conſequents.</p>
            <p>At this Solemnity was preſent an Amphibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Animal, that was in the Mornings an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, and in the Afternoons a Courtier; in the Fore-noons he went in his Gown to the Hall, either to plead or liſten, and in the Evenings as fine as he knew how to make himſelf, courted Ladies. He was one of thoſe young Students that in ſpite of their Birth and Education, will paſs for Gallants; and when they fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be dreſt <hi>a la mode,</hi> and contemn or rally their Kindred, imagine they have acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a degree of elevation above their equals.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108350:9"/> You could not have known him after a change of habit; His Hair which he wore ſhort when he went a Mornings to the Hall, was in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings covered with a fair Flaxen Periwig, moſt frequently viſited by a Comb that was oftner in his hand than his Pocket. His Hat bore ſo great reſpect to it, it durſt hardly touch it; His Head and Shoulders were alwayes well powdred, his Ribbons abundant, and his Linnen richly laced; but what moſt ſet him out, was, that he had luckily a Wart on his Cheek, that gave him an honeſt pretence to wear a Black Patch: in a word he was ſo fine, that a Countrey Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would have made him his Pattern to dreſs by: but I did ill to ſay he was not then to be known, his Meen, Geſture, Countenance, and Diſcourſe ſufficiently diſcovered him; for theſe are not ſo eaſily ſhifted as Suits of Clothes, and his Grimaces and Affectations made evident that he imitated Courtiers onely in what they are defective and ridiculous. This may by the way be ſaid of all that imitate in what kind ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he caſt his Eyes of <hi>Javota,</hi> for that is the Name of the Charitable Collectreſs, he fell deſperately in love, which was not very extraordinary to him that was an univerſal Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morado; yet at this time Love bent his Bow more ſtrongly, or drew his Arrow more home, ſo that it pierced his Heart beyond what was uſual. I cannot preciſely deſcribe the motions of his heart at the approach of this Beauty (for no body then felt his Pulſe) but this I can aſſure
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108350:9"/> you, that that day he made a ſolemn Vow to ſerve her; for which immediately after a happy occaſion preſented. A little Clerk that ſat near him, extreamly malicious and enraged againſt <hi>Javota,</hi> becauſe ſhe had taken the Key of the Wine Cellar from a Maid Servant that uſed to draw him Wine, obſerving how proud ſhe ſeemed to have filled her Baſon with Gold and Silver, drew a handful of Farthings from his Pocket, and with them beſpattred her Baſon, to affront her by covering over the Pieces ſhe ſo much gloried in; the Collectreſs bluſhed, and with her Finger put aſide as well as ſhe could that Copper Mony, which for all her addreſs appeared too plainly: Then <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (for ſo the new Inamorado was called) preſenting her a Piſtol, pretended to deſire Silver for it, but he took nothing away but the Farthings, making her a free Preſent of the reſt.</p>
            <p>This new manner of Courtſhip was very well obſerved by <hi>Javota,</hi> rejoyced her heart, and perſwaded her ſhe had a real Obligation to him; on which accompt coming out of the Church, ſhe ſuffered him to accoſt her with a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had been ſtudying all the time of the Sermon. The occaſion was very favorable, for <hi>Javota</hi> never went abroad without her Mother, who kept her ſo reſerv'd, ſhe ſuffered her not to ſpeak to a Man either at home or abroad; Acceſs had not otherwiſe been very difficult to him, for as <hi>Javota</hi> was an Attorneys Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> an Advocate, their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had ſo neer an Affinity and Sympathy, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108350:10"/> Familiarity was as eaſily made between them, as between a Chaplain and a Waiting Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>At his firſt coming up, as a moſt refined Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, he told her, <hi>Madam, With the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of ſo great Merit and Beauty, you muſt needs have made a happy Collection. Alas Sir,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Javota,</hi> with great ſimplicity, <hi>Excuſe me, I have been counting it with the Parſon, and find but Sixty four Livres five Sous, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striſs</hi> Henriette <hi>a while ago gathered Fourſcore; it is true indeed that ſhe collected all the while the Prayers of 40 hours laſted, and in a Church where the beautifulleſt Paradice was expoſed that hath yet been ſeen. When I ſpeak of the good ſucceſs of your Collection,</hi> ſaid <hi>Nicodemus, I mean not only the Almes you have acquired for the poor of the Church, but the profit you have made to your ſelf. Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Javota, I aſſure you I made not any, there was not a Farthing more than I told you, can you imagine I would uſe deceit on ſuch an occaſion? I mean neither Gold nor Silver,</hi> (replied <hi>Nicodemus) but that all perſons that gave you their Alms, at the ſame time preſented their Hearts. I know not,</hi> returned <hi>Javota, what you mean by hearts, but I found not one in the Baſon. I mean</hi> (ſaid <hi>Nicodemus) that there was not any to whom you preſented your ſelf, that at the ſight of ſo great Beauty, made not a Vow to love and ſerve you, on that account preſenting you his heart: For what concerns my ſelf, I found it impoſſible to refuſe you mine. Javota</hi> inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently replied, <hi>Well Sir, If you gave it me, I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108350:10"/> immediately prayed God to restore it you. What,</hi> ſaid <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> ſomewhat angry, <hi>muſt I that am ſo ſerious, be rallied, and the moſt paſſionate of all your ſervants be uſed thus?</hi> At this <hi>Javo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> bluſhing, anſwered, <hi>Conſider Sir what you ſay, I am an honeſt Maid, and have no Servants, my Mother hath forbid me to have any. I have not ſaid any thing</hi> (replied <hi>Nicodemus) that can juſtly offend you, and my paſſion for you is pure and chaſte, and tends to a legitimate pretence. By this Sir it ſeems you would marry me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Javota, to which purpoſe you must apply your ſelf to my Father and Mother; neither do I know what portion they will give me. We are not yet come ſo far</hi> (quoth <hi>Nicodemus) I muſt firſt have ſome teſtimony of your eſteem, and know whether you accept of my ſervice. Sir</hi> (ſaid <hi>Javota</hi>) I <hi>can very well ſerve my ſelf, and do all that is neceſſary to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This City Reply diſarmed our Gallant, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to court in a lofty ſtile, and would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been very prodigal of complements, had he met one that underſtood them. He was not a little ſurprized that at his firſt proffers of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he was entertained as a ſerious Woer; but he had little reaſon, for it is the ordinary defect of Maids of this condition, to take a Man to be in love with them on the leaſt expreſſion of Civility; and as ſoon as in love, bound to go to the Parſon and marry, or at leaſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted before Friends. They underſtand not thoſe ſecret and charming Intelligences, which paſs part of our youth with ſo great delight, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108350:11"/> are not inconſiſtent with the ſevereſt vertue: They are not ſollicitous to make a perfect diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the good or evil qualities of ſuch as offer their ſervice, nor know how on the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of eſteem to raiſe a Superſtructure of Love or Friendſhip. Their fear of living and dying Maids, makes them immediately graſp at what is ſubſtantial, and blindly catch at him that makes the firſt overture. And this is the cauſe of the great difference between Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Citizens; for the Gentry making an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Profeſſion of Gallantry, and uſed to the Converſe of Ladies from their Infancy, form a certain habit of Civility and Courtſhip that laſts all their lives: whereas the Vulgar never acquire that free and becoming Aire, nor ever ſtudy that Art of pleaſing, which cannot be learned but amongſt Ladies, nor till civilized by ſome tender p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſion. They make not love but by the by, and with conſtraint, aiming immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately at Marriage. Neither is it ſtrange that all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſt of their lives they have a clowniſh and refractory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is a burthen to their Family, and odious to all that frequent them. Our piece of a Courtier pretended to make love very formally, loath to omit any one of the Ceremonies he had learned in his Books; for he had commenced Maſter of Art in <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Clelia;</hi> he reſolved therefore to write Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, give treats, and what is worſt of all make Verſes; but what poſſibility is there of playing a good ſet at Tennice with one that alwayes ſtrikes under Line.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:108350:11"/>
            <p>As ſoon as he had brought his Miſtriſs to her Door, with a low Curtſie ſhe took her leave, telling him ſhe muſt go and look after Houſhold Affairs, and that her Mother would chide, if ſhe ſaw her talking with Men; he was therefore forced to with-draw, though with reſolution ſpeedily to give her a Viſit. But it ſeemed very difficult to get entrance into the Houſe, for none was received that had not buſineſs, and they admitted no farther than the Attorneys ſtudy; for if any came to ask for <hi>Javota,</hi> the Mother immediately went to Door with <hi>What buſineſs have you with my Daughter?</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity therefore obliged <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to ſeek ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with <hi>Vollichou Javota</hi>'s Father, which was not very difficult, he already know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Perſon, having ſeen him in the Court where he was Attorney, and where <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſometime pleaded. He went therefore to him with pretence of conſulting about ſomething that was difficult in practice, and afterwards told him he ſhould be Attorney to one of his Clients, which though he performed, it brought him no farther than the Study: the Womens appartment being as inacceſſible to him as if it had been a <hi>Seraglio:</hi> he therefore beat his brains for ſome invention to get nearer, and at laſt pretended he had a Warren in the Countrey, from whence they ſent him excellent Rabbets, of which he would preſent <hi>Vollichou</hi> a Couple, and come and eat them with him; imagining that at leaſt at Dinner he ſhould have a ſight of the Mother and Daughter: he therefore cauſed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108350:12"/> a Couple to be bought at the Polterers, but it was but Money thrown away, not becauſe they were tame Rabbets (for the Attorney liked them well enough) but becauſe they got him not a ſight of his Miſtriſs, who that day dined not in publick; perhaps becauſe not dreſt, or employed about ſome Houſhold Affair; he therefore deſigned yet farther, and agreed with <hi>Vollichou</hi> upon a Game at Bowls, which is the greateſt kindneſs you can do an Attorney, and the moſt powerful Adamant to draw him out of his Study. This quickly made them great friends, which was very much forwarded by <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his ſuffering him to win his Money; the laſt Game was for a Capon to be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaten at the Attorneys.</p>
            <p>It was not till the fourth or fifth Capon, that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had the pleaſure of ſeeing his Miſtriſs at Table with him, and this laſted not long, for ſhe came not till a good while after Dinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, roſe when the Cheeſe came, folding her Napkin, and carrying away her Trencher her ſelf. Neither did ſhe ſpeak a word during the whole Meal, nor ſcarcely lift up her Eyes, with extraordinary modeſty making appear that ſhe knew how to practiſe all that is to be learned in the <hi>Sententiae Pueriles.</hi> Immediately after ſhe ſhut her ſelf up in a Chamber with her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to work on ſome Lace or Tapeſtry. In a word, there never was Maid with whom it was ſo difficult to enter into Converſation; for at home ſhe was kept very ſtrait, and abroad ſhe never went without her Mother: ſo that had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108350:12"/> not the accident of the Collection given her a moments liberty, and to go home alone, <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> had never met an opportunity of accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. His acquaintance with <hi>Vollichou</hi> was in a manner uſeleſs, yet it augmented daily, but to underſtand its foundations the better, it will not be amiſs to give a Character of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney.</p>
            <p>He was a thick ſhort fellow beginning to be grey, and of the ſame age with his Night-Cap, he had grown old with it under a greaſie and flapping Hat, that had covered more Knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries than could be contained in a hundred other Heads, and under a hundred other Night-Caps; for petty fogging had ſeized on the Corps of this little man as the Devil does on one that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt. But they were certainly much too blame that uſed to ſay the Devil would have him; they ought rather to have called him <hi>Damning</hi> than <hi>Damned;</hi> ſince he effectually either damned or undid all he had to do with, whether his Clients or adverſe Parties. His mouth was wide, no little advantage to one that gets his living by bawling, and whoſe beſt quality is to have able Lungs; his Eyes were penetrating, and his Ear ſo quick, it could diſtinguiſh the chink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Ten Groats Five hundred Paces off; he had a moſt nimble wit, alwayes provided he imploied it not in what was honeſt. None was ever more aſſiduous, not to ſerve but rob his Clients. He looked on other mens Eſtates as Cats on a Bird in a Cage, when dancing about it, they watch how they may lay their Paws
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108350:13"/> upon it. He yet ſometimes ſeemed very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and if he met a poor man ignorant of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, would cry out aloud he would draw his Declaration <hi>gratis,</hi> but before he obtained any effect of it, he was ſure to pay double. He had a natural antipathy againſt the truth, ſo that never any, though to his advantage, durſt come near him, for fear of being contradicted.</p>
            <p>You may eaſily judge that with theſe rare Endowments he could not fail of becomming rich, and withal infamous, which cauſed a wit once to ſay very pertinently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That all he had was unjuſtly gotten, his reputation excepted.</hi> This he himſelf would ſometimes agree to, but with aſſurance that he was very much altered, and to invite <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to walk in the paths of Vertue, he once told him that in the one year he had lived honeſtly he got more than in ten others when he played the Knave; and perhaps he might truly enough ſay this, for the Fines with which ſome of his Cheats had been puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, coſt him very dear.</p>
            <p>You ſee here what <hi>Vollichou</hi> was, who came at laſt to be ſo decryed, the Hangman himſelf whoſe Attorney he had been, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him as unworthy to ſerve him; Judge now whether <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that was not very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varitious, but extreamly amorous, might not eaſily gain the good opinion of one ſo greedy; he pleaded his Cauſes for little or nothing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a ſmall yearly Stipend; he preſented, treated, and uſed all endeavors to gain his Friendſhip; but one particular humor rendred
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108350:13"/> them inſeparable, which was, that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was a great Speaker of Sentences, high and lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty expreſsions, and <hi>Vollichou</hi> no leſs of Proverbs and Clinches, and in theſe applauding one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, their Converſation was very diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>But although this great acquaintance began to give <hi>Nicodemus</hi> free acceſs to the Houſe, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified little towards entertaining <hi>Javota,</hi> for as ſoon as he appeared, ſhe either went into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chamber, or if ſhe ſtayed, ſpoke not one word, ſo reſpective ſhe was in her Mothers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; who never was from her. He was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therefore to declare himſelf a Suitor, that he might get opportunity to ſpeak to her with freedom. He was not a little encouraged to pretend to make her his Wife, becauſe an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneys Daughter is a very ſuitable match for an Advocate; for <hi>Vollichou</hi> was rich, and had very good practice, which might better be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Trade, ſince he ſold his Clients. On the other ſide he would not have a Son in Law of any other Profeſsion. He cared not to have him handſom, neat, or gallant, provided he were induſtrious and thrifty: neither did he ſo highly value <hi>Javota</hi>'s beauties, as to expect by it to make her a Fortune; in this perhaps he was not without reaſon, and they that make a ſtate of it, are oftentimes deceived, and the fortunes Maids of this quality acquire by advantage of their beauty, uſually end in the proſecution of the Relations of the Youngman they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled, and a Divorce themſelves ſue for,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108350:14"/> when they find they are married to a ruined Coxcomb.</p>
            <p>This favorable inclination cauſed <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (importuned alſo by his love) to make a free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to <hi>Javota</hi>'s Father, and a preciſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Marriage; who receiving the propoſal with all the civility a man of his humor was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, made an exact inquiry into <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his Eſtate, whether it were not incumbred, and if he were free from Debts and Diſeaſes. All the apparent difficulty was, that the Bridegroom was too handſom, too ſpruce and courtly; for to ſay truth, that which pleaſeth people of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, thwarts moſt theſe Graybeards. He ſaid the time that was ſpent in ſo neat dreſſing was loſt, and might be better imployed in engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and that ſuch a Suit of Cloths coſt Twenty Fees: Notwithſtanding all which, the good opinion he had entertained of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> effaced the diſlikes, and becoming indulgent in what concerned him, he ſaid, <hi>That Youth muſt have its Courſe, but ſuppoſing that extended no farther then to the getting a Wife, he doubted not in three Moneths to ſee him as very a ſloven as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt having examined the Inventory and all the Evidences of his Eſtate, formed and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the Articles of Marriage, and ſigned the Contract, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was permitted to viſit his Miſtriſs with a little more liberty, that is at the far end of the Chamber in her Mothers preſence, who was the while imployed at her Needle. But this laſted not long, for <hi>Vollichou</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:108350:14"/> cauſed all things to be prepared to contract them, and withal the Bains to be asked in the Church.</p>
            <p>I am afraid there is not any Reader (be he never ſo courteous) but will cry out here is a pitiful <hi>Romancer.</hi> This Story is neither long nor intricate, and a Wedding reſolved already, which is not wont to be till the 10th Volume; but I beg his pardon for cutting ſhort, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding poſt to the concluſion, and think him not a little obliged to me for freeing him from the impatience that torments many Readers to ſee an Amorous Hiſtory laſt ſo long, without being able to divine the concluſion; yet he may pleaſe to obſerve that many things fall between the Cup and Lip: and this Wedding is not in ſuch forwardneſs as he imagines.</p>
            <p>It is now in my power to form here a Heroine that ſhall be ſtollen away, as often as I have a mind to write Volumns: for it is a very ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry misfortune to Hero's, when they think they have their Miſtriſſes in their Arms, to embrace only a Cloud, and feed themſelves with wind like unhappy <hi>Ixion,</hi> whilſt one of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades carries her away in ſpite of their teeth.</p>
            <p>But ſince I intend not here to make oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deluding Scenes, and have promiſed you a true Hiſtory, I will ingeniouſly confeſs, that this Wedding was prevented only by an oppoſal at asking the Bains, in name of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Maid called <hi>Lucrece,</hi> who pretended to have had a promiſe of Marriage from <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> This intirely loſt him in the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108350:15"/> of <hi>Javota</hi>'s Parents, who looked on him as debaucht, in ſuch manner that they would no longer either ſee or ſuffer him. To tell you from whence this oppoſition proceeded (for which methinks you have a curioſity) we muſt go a little higher, and give you another Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but whileſt I relate it, forget not that I have already told you; for you will hereafter have occaſion for it.</p>

               <p>THis <hi>Lucrece,</hi> which I call of the <hi>City,</hi> to diſtinguiſh her from that <hi>Roman</hi> that ſtabbed her ſelf, and was of a very different humor, was a tall handſom Maid, that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neither wit nor ſpirit, but abounded in vanity. 'Twas pity ſhe had not been bred at Court or amongſt Perſons of Quality, which would have freed her from many affectations that wronged her good parts, and too clearly made evident the place of her Education.</p>
               <p>She was Daughter of a Regiſter of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> and left very young with little portion, to the Conduct of an Aunt, an Advocates Wife of the Third Order, I mean that was neither eminent nor altogether without practice:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108350:15"/> This good man, more laborious than learned, was all day ſhut up in his Study, where he got his living by drawing Writings, but ſlightly paid for, and knew not all that paſſed in his Houſe: His Wife was ſo good a huſwife, ſhe would have maundred two dayes for waſting a Candles end, or throwing away a Match before it had been lighted at both ends; but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide ſhe was a great Gameſter, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, as ſhe uſed to expreſs it, though it was properly no more but to ſee many faces. After Dinner Cards and Tables were produced, and immediately a great many young people of all conditions, reſorted thither more to ſee <hi>Lucrece</hi> than to divert Mrs Advocate. When ſhe won, ſhe affected to appear liberal, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a Tart and Puff-paſte, which with ſome Sweet-Meats made in the Houſe, gave a Treat to the Company.</p>
               <p>This ſerved inſtead of Supper to her ſelf and Niece, and ſometimes alſo to her Husband, though he never taſted it; for ſhe forgot to provide for him, when ſhe her ſelf was not hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry. On this accompt ſhe paſſed amongſt the Neighbourhood for very ſplendid: her houſe-keeping was much cried up, and I heard a Clerks Wife that lived thereabouts, ſay in choler, <hi>None it ſeems may pretend to Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, but Mrs</hi> Advocate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucrece</hi> then was bred in a Family thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, a dangerous Poſt for a Maid that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous, and on that account obliged to ſuffer all ſort of Gallants. Her heart muſt have been
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108350:16"/> froſt-nailed to have gone firm in ſo ſlippery a road. All her fortune was built on the Charms and Conqueſts of her Eyes, a very ſlender and feeble foundation, that ſeems only to make old Maids, and to marry them by a Suit in the Arches.</p>
               <p>She yet carried the Garb of one of Quality, though as I have ſaid, her portion was little or rather nothing at all; and ſhe was reported to have Fifteen thouſand Crowns.</p>
               <p>On which ſuppoſition though falſe <hi>Lucrece</hi> built high expectations, and if an Advocate were propounded as a Husband for her, <hi>Fie,</hi> ſhe would cry out, <hi>I hate theſe Gown and Pen and Ink-horn Men.</hi> She pretended to a Knight or at leaſt an Eſquire, and her Charms drew many Servants, for a Houſe that keeps an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Academy of Gaming, keeps one alſo of Love, which is at firſt very honeſt, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards no more than needs muſt; this puts me in mind of what was once ſaid by a good fellow, <hi>That to do ſo, is little leſs than to hang out a Buſh to publiſh there is ſome excellent piece ready to be ſet abroach.</hi>

               <p>They came, as I told you, more to ſee <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crece</hi> than to play, yet there was a neceſſity of playing, that they migbt ſee her. Some having played a while gave their Cards to another to hold, whileſt they courted her; others went her Aunts halves; ſhe alſo went halves with ſome others that engaged to play: but having put her forces in order, ſhe went up and down the Hall entertaining the Company, and knew ſo well
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108350:16"/> how to content them all, by affording each a ſhare of her Converſation, that you would have thought ſhe had regulated her diſcourſe by the Hour-Glaſs.</p>
               <p>She made no ſmall profit by play, having her ſhare of what was won, but never participating in any loſs. Nothing pleaſed her ſo much as when certain Coxcombs fell into her hands, that think it an excellent Complement to let Ladies win their Money: by ſuch an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way to poſſeſs them of the Preſents they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make them. This was a great miſtake of old, with which (thanks be to heaven) Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and Gallants are now no more abuſed. It is true that crafty Wenches are very well pleaſed to win at play, but looking on that effect which they attribute to their own skill or good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune as Conqueſt, they do not think themſelves in the leaſt obliged to the poor Fool that loſeth his money, but call him their Cully, and never give him over till they have plucked his laſt fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and it is then too late to go to work with ſome other Gallantry; for they never eſteem a man that hath played the Fool, though to their advantage. And indeed to what purpoſe ſo much Ceremony? is it not better to play ones beſt, and neither excuſe nor over-ſee any thing; and if we be minded to preſent them, do it without circumſtance or diſguiſe. Do any of them refuſe or ſend back what is preſented them, this may poſſibly have been done in the dayes of old when they knew not how to live; but if we improve at the rate we have done
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108350:17"/> lately, for my part I bylieve we ſhall ere long make direct bargains, and ſay I ſend you ſuch a preſent for ſuch a favour, and demand ſecurity; for to ſpeak ſeriouſly Women are deceitful. But while I talk of Gaming, I have almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got <hi>Lucrece,</hi> who above all other Gallants lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thoſe that uſed to play for diſcretions; for if ſhe loſt, ſhe paid with ſome ribbon, and if ſhe won, expected Jewels. She was clothed with nothing elſe but the good fortune of Play, or folly of her Servants. The Silk Stockings on her Legs were a diſcretion, her Ribbon and Gloves another diſcretion; her Whiske of <hi>Point de Gennes</hi> another.</p>
               <p>In a word, from head to foot ſhe was all diſcretion. But ſhe played ſo long for diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that at laſt ſhe loſt her own, as you will hear anon: I give you notice betimes, becauſe I deſign nor to ſurprize you, as ſome malicious Authors are wont to do, who aime at nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the many Lovers, whoſe youthful fervor adored <hi>Lucrece,</hi> was a young Lord, but to ſay <hi>Lord</hi> ſignifies little, without adding 40, 50, or 60 thouſand Livres a year; for there are ſo many of theſe of late Editions, and Forreign and Exotick Impreſſion, that they are little conſiderable, unleſs with their Lordſhips they make us acquainted with their Revenue, as one did that ſtyled bimſelf Lord of Twenty hundred thouſand Crowns. This never yet gave in any accompt, but he lived high, with daily change of Clothes, Feathers, and Ribbons, which in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108350:17"/> 
                  <hi>Paris</hi> are commonly the beſt teſtimonies of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality, though to ſpeak ſeriouſly, not a little deceitful. He had ſeen <hi>Lucrece</hi> in the Church, I had almoſt ſaid that I have deſcribed, whither he went on the Solemn Day I told you of, on what account I know not, but certainly on any, rather than to ſay his Prayers. As ſoon as he ſaw her he was charmed, and as ſoon as ſhe went out, ſent his Page to enquire after her, but before his Pages return he was made acquainted with all by the Sexton, that drives away Dogs and lets Pews; but makes greater profit by underſtanding the Intrigues of all the Women of the Pariſh, than by both the other Trades. A Half Crown Piece therefore got my Lord the Name, Dwelling, and Quality of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crece,</hi> with her Aunts, and their uſual imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Names of the moſt of thoſe that frequented them; with many other particulars, that could not have been learned of a private Family without much time; which makes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that ſuch as are ſo governed, begin to be publick. Being very diſcreet, he ſtudied how to find ſome body to introduce him, for want of which, he reſolved to make uſe of the pretence of Play, the great Paſspartout that admits into ſuch Companies. But as it fell out, he ſtood in need of none of theſe, for paſſing next day in his Coach through the Street where <hi>Lucrece</hi> dwelt, he perceived her at the door, whither her impatience to have received no Viſit, drew her: and as ſhe heard the noiſe of a Coach, ſhe turned her head that way, thinking it was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108350:18"/> ſome body coming to her. The Lord placed himſelf in the Boot, the more conveniently to ſalute and enter diſcourſe with her.; and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate accident was but too favorable: an Oſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Boy galloping a Horſe that he pricked with a ruſty Spur faſtened to his left Shoe, the Street being narrow and the Kennel broad, covered the Coach, the Lord and Lady with dirt. The Lord was about to ſwear, but reſpect of the fair Sex reſtrained him; he would have ſent after, but the Trooper was ſo well mounted they could do him no hurt, unleſs they ſhot him flying: he therefore alighted all dirty as he was, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <hi>Lucrece,</hi> and at his firſt approach told her, <hi>Madam, I have been puniſhed for my temerity in approaching too near to behold you, but I am not ſo much troubled to ſee my ſelf in this condition, as that you partake of this dirty preſent. Lucrece</hi> out of countenance to ſee her ſelf ſo accoutred, or perhaps becauſe ſhe had no Complement rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on ſo unexpected an accident, could ſay no more, but civilly offer him the Hall to make himſelf clean, or tarry in while he ſent for ſhift, and then took her leave and went to change her own Linnen; ſhe quickly returned with other Clothes, and it was occaſion of no little pride to a perſon of her condition, to make appear ſhe had variety, and could ſo ſuddenly produce a Whiske of Point of <hi>Sedan</hi> inſtead of that of <hi>Genoua</hi> ſhe left off.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing the Lord did, was to ſend his Page home in all haſte, to bring him another Suit and other Linnen, hoping they would let
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108350:18"/> him have ſome Chamber where he might ſhift himſelf. But the Page comes back ſweating, to tell him that his <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> had carried away the Key of the Wardrobe, and that after he had dreſſed his Lord a Mornings, he uſed not to return till Night, as thoſe Loiterers uſe to do, whoſe Maſters leave them to drink and play, for want of other buſineſs; imagining it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from their greatneſs to imploy a Servant in more than one Office. He had therefore no remedy but patience, which could not yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him from condemning his little ſore-ſight, that he had not taken along in his Coach in a Band-Box another Suit of Linnen, ſince his Coachman was ſo provident to carry Hammer and Nails, to faſten his Horſe-ſhoes or mend any thing that might be broken about the Wheel. But he could do no more at that time than place himſelf in the darkeſt corner of the Hall, and againſt the light to conceal his wounds as well as was poſſible. He hath ſworn ſince (though that is not it that obliges us to believe him, for he ſometimes ſwore vainly enough; but I have met ſome Profeſſors of Gallantry that told me it was very poſſible) that amongſt all his amorous Adventures, he never ſuffered greater vexation nor more bitter reſentment, then to be fain to appear in ſo bad a poſture the firſt time he ſaw his Miſtriſs. Notwithſtanding the violence of his love often preſſed him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his paſſion, and that he found favorable occaſions for it, he put up all his Complements, and imagining the ſpots on his Clothes were ſtains to his honour, became extreamly morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108350:19"/> like a Peacock that looking on his feet, immediately lets fall his Train.</p>
               <p>To increaſe his misfortune, he was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſeated, but there came in a great many Maids of <hi>Lucrece</hi> Neighbourhood, of whom ſome were her friends, others not; for all flocked thither as to a General Rendezvous of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, there to ſeek Husbands, as others go to the <hi>Intelligence Office</hi> to enquire for Lackeys or <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets de Chambre</hi>'s; ſome ſat down to Cards with young Men that were newly come in, others prated with <hi>Lucrece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not knowing the Lord, they took him for ſome pitiful Countrey Gentleman, and ſo uſed him, for City Dames as well as Court Ladies, have got the trick of rallying theſe; and here they failed not to give every one her Attaque. <hi>It muſt be confeſſed,</hi> ſays one, <hi>this Gentleman is very well dreſt to day, for he wants no Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches; But,</hi> ſaid another, <hi>is it the faſhion to wear them upon Linnen;</hi> the third added, <hi>Though poſſibly he forgot to take Holy Water this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſomebody hath had the charity to be ſprinkle him:</hi> and the laſt, a bold Goſsip, replied, <hi>Alas, all this will be nothing but a little duſt at Midſummer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord at firſt ſuffered all theſe wipes, which are very common ones, with a great deal of patience, and preſſed by conſcience of his guilt, durſt not juſtifie himſelf againſt an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation that ſo evidently convinced him. But they at laſt provoked him ſo far, he could not avoid a Reply. <hi>I perceive well</hi> (Ladies) ſaid he, <hi>you will put a neceſſity upon me of defending Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, but I know not how I ſhall acquit my ſelf in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108350:19"/> it, having hitherto very little meditated on that ſubject, becauſe I thought I ſhould never have occaſion for it on my own account, nor had not, but for the misfortune lately happened to me. You will be the leſs partial</hi> (replied <hi>Lucrece) if you have ſo little intereſt in the Cauſe, and oblige a great many perſons, if you plead it well. I am not of a Profeſſion,</hi> ſaid the Lord, <hi>to plead or make Apologies, but ſuch an occaſion preſenting for it, I muſt tell you that I think it very ſtrange that in moſt companies men are neither reſpected nor ſcarcely ſuffered, unleſs all about them be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and proper even to exceſs; nay ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs rich and magnificent. Mens merits are not at all examined, and judgement is made of them only by their outſides, and by qualifications that may at all times be taken up at the Mercers and Lacemen. Tbis is very true,</hi> ſaid one, <hi>and</hi> Paris <hi>is ſo full of dirt it is impoſſible to eſcape it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have to day found by experience</hi> (ſaid the Lord) <hi>that it is hard to do ſo, ſince my Coach could not ſecure me; and I muſt needs approve of their opinion, that maintain that ſuch as are curious, ought to uſe Sedans. The old Proverb, which to expreſs one that is ſo, ſays he,</hi> Looks as if he came out of a Box, <hi>is now a days verified; and perhaps gave occaſion for theſe portable Boxes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> ſaid the City Dame (again interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him) <hi>every one cannot pay for them, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters exact and are too chargeable. Once when it rained I would have been carried to</hi> Noſtre Dame, <hi>and they asked a Crown. It is true,</hi> ſaid the Lord,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108350:20"/> 
                  <hi>the charge is great, and cannot be born by ſuch as are in low or mean conditions, as moſt perſons of merit are; who by reaſon of this are confined to the Viſits of their Neighbours only, as in little Cities, and cannot enjoy the advantages</hi> Paris <hi>would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe afford them; for here we might ſelect a handſome ſociety of the beſt qualified perſons, did not chance and buſineſs ſcatter them into ſeveral very diſtant Quarters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not long ſince a Gallant made me a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant complaint on ſuch an accident, He went,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>from the</hi> Fauxbourgs St. Germain, <hi>intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the</hi> Marais de Temple, <hi>with pure Linnen and a neat Suit, his Galloches very ſtreight and the day fair; he moſt ſucceſsfully ſaved himſelf from dirt by the favor of Shops and Alleys, into which he very judiciouſly retreated at the leaſt noiſe of Horſe or Coach At laſt; thanks to his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and the many compaſſes he had taken to pick out the faireſt way, he came near the deſired Haven, when a poor Aſs, that went modeſtly enough his grand Paw, and probably meant no miſchief, ſet his foot in a hole, and almoſt the only hole in the Street, and daſhed him as plentifully as could have been done by the boundingſt Horſe that is ridden to the great Saddle; upon this he durſt not continue his deſign, but lapping himſelf up in his Cloak, very diſcontentedly returned to his Lodging. Thus he was unfortunately bereaved of the pleaſure he expected in his Viſit, and they which were to receive it, of the ſatisfaction of his entertainment. This accident gave him ſuch an averſion for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Viſits, that he hath loſt all the acquaintnce
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108350:20"/> he had out of his own Quarter. Your friend</hi> (ſaid <hi>Lucrece) was a little too ſcrupulous, had he done well, he ſhould have thought it ſufficient at his firſt entrance to have made an excuſe in behalf of dirty Stockings, an invective againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City and the Scavenger, with a word of imprecation againſt the hypocritical Aſs, that was the occaſion of the ſcandal: This ſure had been ſufficient to have ſecured him againſt all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Methinks</hi> (interrupted <hi>Hippolita</hi> (who was a pretender to wit, and began the firſt raillery) <hi>he did very diſcreetly to go back, elſe had any of my humor been in the company, he had certainly been attacqued. Why</hi> (ſaid <hi>Lucrece) was he in any fault? Have you not obſerved his many precautions? What ſhall his time and pains in ſheltring himſelf in ſo many Shops and Alleys ſignifie nothing? No,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hippolita, nothing, why did he not take a Sedan? You enquire not,</hi> ſaid the Lord, <hi>Whether he had wherewithal to pay for one; but you are not ſingle in your humor, and I foreſee if the luxury of the times goes forward, ſome great Perſons, after the examples of thoſe that have founded Chairs for Profeſſors of</hi> Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Phyſick, <hi>and</hi> Mathematicks, <hi>will charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bequeath a Revenue to establiſh Sedans to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gallants cleanlily unto their Miſtriſſes Alcoves, and in a condition to be admitted into good company. Such an Eſtabliſhment,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lucrece, would be admirable, and no leſs commendable than thoſe other for the encouragement of Learning, but it would coſt a great deal, becauſe of the many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Gallantry.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:108350:21"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Eſtabliſhment,</hi> replied the Lord, <hi>will not be ſo ſoon made, and I rather wiſh than expect it for that Ladies ſake</hi> (pointing to <hi>Hippolita,</hi> whoſe Name he knew not) <hi>that ſhe may not meet any more ſuch diſ-ſatisfactions as at preſent.</hi> The Lord ſeemed to ſpeak this with ſome animoſitie, vexed that ſhe had firſt began to rally him; and to be quit, added ſomewhat briskly, <hi>I could yet allow Women of Quality, who have magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Apartments, and converſe with none but ſuch as are brave, thus difficultly to ſuffer other perſons, but I think it ſtrange that City Wives imitate them, they which go a Mornings to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket in liquord Shoes, wrapped up in their Scarfs, and on Houſhold occaſions admit high Shoes into their Chambers, to the no little pains of the Maids arm that rubs the floor; that theſe I ſay ſhould be nicer than all others is inſufferable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certainly,</hi> ſaid Lucrece, <hi>the Gentleman hath a great deal of reaſon, and for a Courtier admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably underſtands the people of the Town: I know ſome perſons (and they are not far off) very hard to be ſatisfied in this particular, and I think would better like a man that ſpoke ten impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in their company, then that had the leaſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity in his Clothes</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hippolita, do you then approve of thoſe</hi> Virtuoſo's, <hi>that under pretence of internal Endowments, altogether neglect the exterior. For example we have in our Neighbourhood a Lawyer very rich and no leſs covetous, that wears a Night Cap down to his Chin, and, had he the Ears of</hi> Midas, <hi>deep enough to cover them; another that goes ever
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108350:21"/> in a thread-bare Cloak; would you excuſe perſons ſo ſordid and extravagant, or deny good company the pleaſure of laughing at them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I do not,</hi> ſaid the Lord, <hi>think that any ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved ſuch affectations, but on the contrary look with contempt and indignation on all formal Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; whoſe Cloaths are as ridiculous as their Manners; we ought yet to be favorable to ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Merit as employing themſelves better, have not time to think of dreſſing; not that I would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thoſe that out of avarice or negligence go ſtill in a posture like enough to make thoſe ſick that look upon them; theſe are extremities equally blamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but how many are there that notwithſtanding their care in dreſſing and concealing their poverty, cannot prevent its appearing in ſome flapping Hat, broken Stocking, or other wound, for which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune alone is to be blamed. You have reaſon,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lucrece, and I have alwayes oppoſed ſuch nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wiſhing it were ſufficient to go decently; but variety and magnificence are alſo required, for now a-dayes Men every where take place according to their Cloaths, and their merits are valued by the depth of their Laced Bands. This muſt be granted,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hippolita, and as I think reaſonably enough, for how can you judge of a Man that comes into company, but by his outſide? If his Cloaths be rich, he is taken for a Perſon of Quality, well born and bred, and conſequently that hath worth. This I could allow you,</hi> ſaid the Lord, <hi>if Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers only were ſo uſed, and excuſe the honour done to a Raſcal, that under favour of his good Cloaths, paſſes for a Perſon of Quality, the honour being
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108350:22"/> paid to the worth that is ſuppoſed to be in him; but they which are beſt known, are ſo dealt with, and many Women judge of Men only by their vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Suits, Feathers, and Ribbons. Coming from a Ball or Viſit, I have heard them thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain one another, What an excellent Set of Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons my Lord had on? I never ſaw a richer: and Sir</hi> Thomas <hi>had a new Stuff I have not ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that was very pretty: another ſaid, That great ſlovenly Squire goes like a Bearherd, he dares not change his Clothes ſure, for fear no body ſhould know him; yet it ſometimes happens that the ſlovenly Squire falls fowl and beats the rich trimming worn by a Coward, and that he that wears the fine Stuff talks like a Coxcomb. Nay one Lady was ſo ſilly, that ſhe commended the extravagance of a Gallant, that to mourn for the death of his Miſtriſs, trimmed a Suit with Black and White Ribbons, with Death-heads and Tears figured upon them, in ſuch a manner as Churches uſe to be hung at Funerals. I think,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lucrece, he may more properly be ſaid to have mourned for his reaſon that was dead. And you are in the right,</hi> ſaid the Lord, <hi>but half mourning would have been ſufficient, it being ſo long ſince it departed. This is very pleaſant,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lucrece, and more than I expected from a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and one that by his Meen ſeems to be curious and magnificent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I muſt acknowledge,</hi> ſaid the Lord, <hi>that my quality obliges me to expence in Clothes, becauſe the humor of the times requires it, and that I may not be taken for moroſe or covetous, I follow Faſhions
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108350:22"/> and ſometimes invent them: but this is contrary to my inclination, and I had much rather divert ſuch fond disburſements into liberalities to Perſons of Merit that ſtand in need of them: and the exceſs of theſe things I have ever blamed, pitying ſuch as fall into the hands of Noble Criticks in Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that abound in idleneſs, and can diſcourſe of nothing elſe; by theſe we are examined from head to foot, like as Malefactors at the Bar, and what care ſo ever we have taken to adjuſt our ſelves, they moſt certainly condemn us. I have been often engaged in Conferences about ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, where many moſt ridiculous queſtions have been controverted very ſeriouſly. I one day ſaw a Coxcomb attacqued on this accompt, one Lady told him his Band was ill put on, another that it was not well ſtarched, a third juſtified the fault to be in the cutting; but he defended himſelf bravely, by telling them it was made by the Kings Semſtreſs, that had a Crown a-piece for the Faſhion. At the Name alone of this Lady, Sentence paſſed in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Band; I ſay Lady, at which you ought not to wonder, for the age is ſo fertil in Ladies, that the Title hath been acquired by common Players, Makers of Periwiggs; and Cutters of Black-patches. That authority,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lucrece, was concluſive, and the queſtion no longer proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical; and it muſt be granted that the Band is the moſt difficult and important of all Ornaments, and firſt diſcovers whether a man be a juſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore too much care and time cannot be emploied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: as I have heard of a great Lawyers Wife that was an hour every Morning putting on her
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108350:23"/> Cuffs, and publickly maintained they could not be well put on ſooner. After the examination of this Band</hi> (ſaid the Lord) <hi>they fell upon Pantaloons, and conſidered whether they had too many folds behind or before, and in this alſo opinions varied; at laſt they came to Silk Stockings, and this was argued a very new and conſiderable controverſie, not yet decided by any Author, whether they do beſt drawn strait or plaited on the Calf of the Leg. After two hours ſpent in ſuch ridiculous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, perceiving they intended to examine all the reſt article by article, and line by line, as if it had been a reckoning; I broke off and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and they adjourend, appointing another day to go on with the reſt: for the determination of a Caſe ſo important required ſeveral Seſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You rally ſo handſomely</hi> (ſaid <hi>Lucrece) the perſons you diſlike, one had need be very careful what they ſay. I have too great reſpect</hi> (replied the Lord) <hi>for all that comes from ſo fair lips, and have obſerved in you conceptions ſo juſt, and remote from all we have rallied, that you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to apprehend on that accompt. Indeed,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lucrece, I do not approve our entertaining our ſelves with ſuch trifles, nor the being ſo punctual as to little defaults, methinks it is enough, if we be ſo habited, that we give no general diſguſt. Beſides I know that what care ſoever can be taken, eſpecially by ſuch as are not Courtiers, ſomething will ſtill be objected; for Faſhions changing daily, and the dayes not being marked in Almanacks like Holydayes, it is neceſſary to have intelligence and Spies at Court, to give notice of the varieties that happen every moment.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:108350:23"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>You have a great deal of reaſon,</hi> replied the Lord, <hi>and the difficulty intimated by you is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt invincible, without erecting an Office of Modes or at leaſt publiſhing a Gazette, which in form of a Journal ſhould acquaint the world with what is new. This deſign</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hippolita) is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and I believe more of theſe Gazets would be ſold than of the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since you pleaſe your ſelf with ſuch deſigns,</hi> ſaid the Lord, <hi>I will acquaint you with an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one I heard propounded a while ago by a Lawyer that ſought ſome Patentee to joyn with him.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>And wonder not that I have correſpondence with this ſort of men, and ſometimes make uſe of their terms; two troubleſome Suits, by obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging me to frequent them, have taught me (to my coſt) more than I cared for learning. He told me it were very neceſſary to the Kingdoms good, to eſtabliſh a great Council of Modes, and that it would be eaſie enough to provide it with Officers: for Councellors of Modes might plentifully be found amongſt Mercers, Drapers, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change-men; and amongſt Taylors Attorneys of Modes, who ſhould fit them for hearing and make their reports. Judges ſhould be choſen amongſt the vanieſt and extravaganteſt Courtiers of both Sexes, who ſhould juſtifie or condemn, and give all authority and credit: there ſhould alſo be Meſſengers of Modes, to diſperſe them thorow the Kingdom; and last of all Cenſors of Modes, who ought to be very diſoreet perſons to limit their extravagances; for example not to ſuffer Hats to riſe as high and pointed as Sugar-loaves, nor fall as flat as Pancakes; which is much to be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108350:24"/> whileſt every man raiſes or depreſſes them in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of his Neighbor, according to the ebbes and flows of the Mode of Hats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhould alſo endeavor a reformation of Clothes, with all neceſſary Decries, as of Ribbons that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly crept up as high as our Pockets; Regulations of all differences that might concern the Juriſdiction, ſhould be kept in the Office, and a Puppet of the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Mode made like a</hi> Jackalent, <hi>to be communicated to the ſeveral Shires. All Taylors ſhould be obliged to theſe Models, no leſs than Carpenters and Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers to thoſe of the Houſes they undertake to build. There ſhould hang up in the Office a Table, in which all Faſhions, with the circumſtances and regulations, ſhould be ſpecified, with the lengths of Cotes, Breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Sleeves, qualities of Stuffs, Trimmings, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and other Ornaments. This would be no ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the publick, and prevent Dutchmen or Countrey-Gentlemen, that beſtow a great deal of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to make themſelves fine, from failing in their deſign, notwithſtanding their conſultations with all manner of Tradeſmen for clearing difficulties. For it often happens, that if the Suit be well, it is not ſo with the Hat or Stockings, and the poor Gallants live alwayes in ignorance and incertainty; whereas then if they doubted (for example) whether their Hats were handſome, they had no more to do, but to carry them to the Mode Office, to have them gaged and meaſured as Pecks and Buſhels are at the Town-Houſe. Being thus examined from head to foot, and taking out an authentick Certificate, their conſciences might be at reſt, and their honour ſecure againſt the reproaches of the moſt critical Ladies.</hi>

               <p>It is great pity (ſaid <hi>Lucrece</hi>) that you joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not with the Inventor of this Monopoly, you would have made it very profitable, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are many Officers in the Kingdome leſs uſeful, and Laws leſs neceſſary then would be ordained by them. And I have heard wiſe men ſay, That there are Countries in the World, where there are Juſtices, expreſsly, for regulation of Clothes, but not being Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, I cannot tell you where they lie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucrece</hi> had ſcarcely made an end, when her Aunt broke her game, and the box ſhe had in her hand, in anger, at an ambs ace, ſhe threw very unhappily: This alſo broke the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, for, ſhe came with a great Cry, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the misfortune which ſhe lamented with as pathetical expreſſions, as if it had endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſafety of the State.</p>
               <p>This diſordered our little <hi>Cabal,</hi> ſome of which, in Civility joyned in the invective againſt the unlucky ambs ace that came uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for, others comforted her, by repreſenting Fortunes Inconſtancy, and promiſing her 2 ſices another time. The Lord, the mean while, that waited for an opportunity to be gone, took leave of <hi>Lucrece:</hi> not without telling her in private, that he hoped to waite on her the next day in better equipage, and begged leave to continue his Viſits. But at his going he was very near ſuffering by the like accident as at his arrival. For Oſtlers are very frequent in that quarter. He could no more beat this then the former, becauſe this alſo rid away,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108350:25"/> but his page revenged him, and not being ſo reaſoable in his Anſwer as his Maſter, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it on another Oſtler that was on foot hard by the gate, and when the fellow cryed out, Hold, Sir, I daſh no body, anſwered, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, This is for thoſe thou haſt daſh'd, and wilt daſh hereafter: A very remarkable equity, [to the ſhame of our Suburb Juſtices.]</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Lord was in his Coach, the footmen, following his and the pages examples, (animated againſt daſhers of the Kings free-born Subjects) fell upon certain Carmen, that ſeemed as haſty as extraordinary Poſts, the great Carts threw a great ſtone, that was looſe, from the pavement, and hit one of the Carmen, that was got up in his Cart, ſuch a blow on the reins, as mighgt have broken anothers back, while the Clown did no more, but ſhake his head, and looking over his ſhoulder, bid him kiſs—and ſo whipping on, was ſoon out of reach of the broken pavement. The Lord came next day to ſee <hi>Lucrece</hi> in an equipage that made apparent it was not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he made the Apology of the preceeding day.</p>
               <p>I take this to have been the Viſit in which he diſcoved his Paſſion, but will not poſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, it is poſsible he did it not till ſome of the dayes following. For both theſe Lovers were very diſcreet, and mentioned not their amours but with great Caution. It is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky for this Hiſtory, that neither <hi>Lucrece</hi> had a friend in whom ſhe confided, nor the Lord
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108350:25"/> any Squire, to give us the particular terms of of their moſt private diſcourſe. Theſe uſe not to be wanting to <hi>Hero's</hi> and <hi>Heroines,</hi> for how otherwiſe, can their adventures be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and fill ſo many vaſt Volumnes: how can their greateſt ſecrets, and, almoſt, their thoughts be made publick? how elſe get we Copies of all their Love-letters, and Verſes, with the reſt that is neceſſary to the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of an Intrigue? Our Lovers kept no ſuch officers, ſo that all their Concerns cannot be told you: Neither did I gather, what I have written, from any one perſon, whoſe Memory muſt needs have fallen very ſhort of retaining all paſſages; but I have gotten a little here, and a little there, and, to confeſs the truth, added ſomething my ſelf. Nevertheleſs, if you be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly deſirous to know the manner of laying open ſuch Paſſions, I can point you out enough, in <hi>Amadis, Aſtrea,</hi> the grand <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and other <hi>Romances;</hi> that I have neither time nor Intention to tranſcribe and ſteal, as moſt Authours doe, that make uſe of the Inventions of ſuch as write before them: nay, I will not give my ſelf the trouble of quoting the Books and pages, for you cannot miſs them, what part ſoever of thoſe Volumnes you accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open: but you will finde ſtill the ſame thing, and, as it is enough to ſet down the firſt word of the Burthen of the Song with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is alſo ſo now, to tell you that our Lord was in love with <hi>Lucrece, &amp;c.</hi> you may eaſily gueſs, and adde what he ſaid, or at leaſt might have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108350:26"/> ſaid, or at leaſt might have ſaid to charme her.</p>
               <p>All that is incumbent on me, is to acquaint you with the ſucceſs of his Love, for, I take for granted, you will be curious to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lucrece</hi> was kinde or cruel, ſince one of theſe is as probable as the other.</p>
               <p>Know then, that the Lord made great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in little time: yet it was neither his wit nor good meen that won her, though he was one of the moſt accompliſhed Gentlemen of <hi>France,</hi> of the moſt charming appearance, and amorous temper; but theſe were not the things that made the greateſt impreſſison, for though ſhe had a value for ſo good parts, ſhe reſolved, never to ingage her heart but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to eſtabliſhing her fortune. The Lord was therefore forced to make more Promiſes then he intended to perform, as much a perſon of honour as he pretended himſelf: for what is there that a Lover wounded to the heart, will make difficulty to promiſe: and what engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will a Gentleman make ſcruple of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rather then diſhonour himſelf by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy alliance? He made his firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to her good opinion by liberality, and ſometimes letting her win his mony, yet in ſuch a manner, as ſhe might perceive, it was not ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, nor for want of Underſtanding the game; then he came to down right Preſents, which (though proud enough) ſhe made no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of receiving, for ſhe abounded not in wealth, ſo much as in vanity: ſhe affected to live high,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108350:26"/> which her own fortune could not maintain. Treats and Promiſes of Pleaſure, the high wayes by which the honour of citie Virgins poſts away, were very frequent, but not yet concluſive, and <hi>Lucrece</hi> beſtow'd but inſignificant favours, which the Lord yet was fain to accept as current mony, but in the end his Paſſion ſo far prevailed, that he gave her a promiſe of Marriage, written and ſigned with his blood, to make it more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick: this is one of the moſt effectual mines for overthrowing a poor maids honour. Few hold it out when this playes, and <hi>Lucrece</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended hers, no better then others had done before her, but gave up her faith and affection to the Lord. There was ever after this a perfect underſtanding between them, yet without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the higheſt of Engagements, each of them was flattered with pleaſing hopes, the Lord of poſſeſſing his Miſtreſs, and <hi>Lucrece</hi> of being a Lady. But this ſatisfyed not our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient Lover, his Paſſion was too violent for a longer expectation of the greateſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Yet there was an invincible obſtacle againſt the making good his Promiſe of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, though he had intended it. He was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age, and had a Mother and Uncle that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed great eſtates, on which the grandeur of his family depended. Neither of theſe would ever have given conſent, ſo that he ſhould have hazarded a diſinheriting, or at leaſt to ſee his marriage made null. He therefore preſſed <hi>Lucrece</hi> closer, and at laſt lighted on a favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108350:27"/> Opportunity, at one of thoſe miſchievous takings of the Air, they ſo often uſed</p>
               <p>Do not yet believe that <hi>Lucrece</hi> ever went without her Aunt, and ſome other maids her Neighbours, accompanied by their Mothers: but good women think their Daughters ſafe enough, as long as they go out a doores with them, and return in the ſame manner. This yet is a trap in which many have been c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ught. For the Country ſtill affords ſomething of Liberty, ſpies being there leſs frequent, and wayes more open for going aſtray, ſo that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long want an opportunity of giving a Miſtreſs a green Gown, as much the Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal minute as when her ſmock is over her ears. Adde to this that Courtiers never ſterve for fear of calling for what they want, and take advantages upon City laſſes, they durſt not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt againſt great perſons, whoſe qualities oblige them to reſpect. To make ſhort, our <hi>Aſſailant</hi> ſo often ſummoned the place, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it ſo cloſe, that he one day ſurpriſed it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded, and far from aſſiſtance; for her Aunt was then buſie at an important game at <hi>Tic-tac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucrece</hi> thus yielded; I am ſorry to tell it; but it is very true: and for her honours ſake, wiſh, I could let you know the pathetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions of her Lover; which had that ſucceſs, which all he had to that time uſed, failed of.</p>
               <p>I believe the ſaffron on his face was very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, for Melancholy had made him very yal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and am of opinion he pulled a Stilletto
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108350:27"/> out of his Pocket to pierce his heart, in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, when he found he could not die of Love. He neglected not to put her in mind of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Marriage he had given her, and of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of others to confirm it. But the worſt is, none of theſe things can be known, becauſe all paſſed in private: nevertheleſs they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantagious towards the <hi>diſcharge</hi> of the Lady: and you ought to believe he preſſed hard, <hi>Lucrece</hi> being a Virtuous maid, that had a great reſpect of her honour, of which, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, you are already ſenſible, if you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved how long ſhe held out, though, if you conſider the manner of her breeding, you may perhaps imagine her a ſlight <hi>Sconce,</hi> that might be ſtormed very eaſily: Whatever you fancy, ſhe was more careful of eſtabliſhing her fortune, then ſetling her Love.</p>
               <p>She went not about, immediately, to carry the Lord to a Scrivener or Parſon, who might probably have been talkative enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge the buſineſs, and ſo given occaſion to the Lords Relations to break it off. She thought earneſt ought to be laid down, before matters came ſo farre, and that it was better for her to hazard ſomething, then miſs an opportunity of making herſelf a great Lady. It cannot be ſaid to be the fault of <hi>Lucrece,</hi> if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Lord kept not his word, which ſhe had been told, was inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amongſt perſons of honour: and truely there were very many that did not blame her, becauſe themſelves had been caught in the like manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This love laſted a while with more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108350:28"/> familiarity then formerly, and without any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Accident, for the Lord had no Rival to diſpute againſt him the place he had gained, or that gave his Miſtreſs falſe intellig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Inventions that have been preſented in ſo many formes, and ſo often turned and patched they can no longer be made uſe of.</p>
               <p>I can, therefore, tell you no more of this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and though I were never ſo curious, all I could inform my ſelf of would be only this, how many Turkies had been eaten at St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> how many diſhes of ſtrawberries and cherries in <hi>May,</hi> at <hi>Vaugizard,</hi> becauſe the Bills of theſe Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are yet to be found in the Inns where they were made, though they were ſometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſcharged by the Lord, who was ſo good a pay-maſter, it derogated from his Nobility. They alſo carryed themſelves ſo diſcreetly, that none could diſcover any privacy more then formerly: all this yet prevented not ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of an Inferiour ranck from courting <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crece,</hi> yet with ſomething of reſpect for the Lord.</p>
               <p>They watched their Advantage in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and as ſoon as he came, gave way to him: For you know, Noblemen are ſomething terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Citizens, and on that account injure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108350:28"/> maids by frighting away Suiters which might be very convenient for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucrece</hi> had accuſtomed her ſervant to permit her to receive all comers, as before, which ſhe did after her fault with greater freedom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe remorſe of Conſcience made her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it to be more publick then indeed it was, &amp; though ſhe flattered herſelf with hopes of being a Lady, yet while the thing was not done, (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being ſo certain but it may fail) ſhe was willing to keep others on her hand, to have recourſe to, in caſe of neceſſity. Beſides this, it is natural to women to love to be courted by perſons of all conditions, though they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſteem nor affection for them.</p>
               <p>In this reſerve of Gallants, ſufficiently nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> made one, he was a great complimenter, and, as I have already ſaid, a univerſal <hi>Inamorado,</hi> but in this <hi>amour</hi> he inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo farre, that one day, having laid open his Paſſion with all the Rhetorick he could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly find out, <hi>Lucrece</hi> told him, ſhe gave no credit to his words, and muſt have more authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick teſtimonies; he anſwered very ſeriouſly ſhe ſhould have them in what kind ſoever ſhe deſired, and ſhe referrred the choice to himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> then to make evidence he would alwayes love her, told her he would immediately give her a promiſe in writing, ſhe laughed and defied him: and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſoon after expreſly retiring unto an Anti chamber, brought a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Marriage, and put it into her hands; ſhe took it, but ſtill continued her rallerie, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108350:29"/> to ſlight it, wrapped in it a <hi>China</hi> Orange ſhe had in her hand; yet ſhe neglected not to lay it up very carefully afterwards, that it might be uſeful when occaſion preſented, if to no other purpoſe, yet to ſhew ſhe once had a ſervant.</p>
               <p>All this paſſed before <hi>Nicodemus</hi> engaged with <hi>Javota,</hi> and a while after it happened that a Proctor called <hi>Villeflattin,</hi> a friend and Neighbour of <hi>Lucrece</hi>'s Uncle coming to ſee him found him in his Chamber by the fire ſide, <hi>Lucrece</hi> was then, by chance, looking in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of hers that ſtood in the ſame Chamber: &amp; as it is uſual with old men to ask maids when they are to be married, this was the <hi>Proctors</hi> firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement. Well Miſtreſs, ſaies he, when ſhall we dance at your Wedding, I know not when, anſwered <hi>Lucrece,</hi> ſmiling, but this I am ſure of, it needs not be deferred for want of Servants: look you here is a promiſe of marriage were I pleaſed to accept it; with that ſhe ſhewed him a paper folded up, which was the Promiſe ſhe had accidentally lighted on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which yet ſhe did not much value, for ſhe grounded all her hopes on that of the Lord, which ſhe was too cunning once to mention. The Proctor read the other, and told her, he knew the perſon that had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it, and that he was rich, but added no farther commendation, as thinking that word contained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t could be ſaid. He asked if the Promiſe were reciprocal, and whether ſhe had given another? <hi>Lucrece</hi> without affirming or denying, ſtill anſwered fooling: but he ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108350:29"/> recommended to her the care of it, offering his ſervice on that occaſion, and to make an exact inquiry after <hi>Nicodemus</hi> eſtate.</p>
               <p>A few dayes after, it happened that <hi>Villeflat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> met <hi>Vollichou Javota's</hi> father, and being of his old Acquaintance, <hi>Vollichou</hi> told him of his daughters approaching wedding: <hi>Villeflat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> immediately wiſhed him joy, ſaying it was well done to marry her young, that Maids were as difficult to be kept as Treaſure, and that a father is never at quiet till he is no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for their freaks, and their husbands obliged to take care of them. That <hi>Javota</hi> was, queſtionleſs, very diſcreet, but the times were ſo corrupt, and youth ſo deboiſt, there was no more ſcruple made of ſurpriſing an innocent Virgin, then of drinking a glaſs of water. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other diſcourſes of the like nature, which I purpoſely omit, not for want of Information, (for I have heard them a thouſand times) he asked whom he had choſen to his Alliance, and when the Wedding was to be ſolemniſed. <hi>Volli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chou</hi> replyed, the Banes had been already asked at St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> and St. <hi>Severine</hi> the pariſhes of both parties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they were to be contracted within two dayes, and that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was to be his Son in Law. How? (ſaid <hi>Villeflattin</hi>) I have heard he was to have Miſtris <hi>Lucrece</hi> our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? I have ſeen, read, and had in my hand a Promiſe of Marriage to that purpoſe, authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly ſigned by him. You very much ſurpriſe me (ſaid <hi>Vollichou</hi>) and, I beſeech you, Inform
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108350:30"/> me better, and tell me whether—and then without concluding, left him haſtily, crying out, <hi>Who calls</hi> Vollichou? This was a certain Sollicitor that brought a ſmall Client, they would not let go up ſtairs.</p>
               <p>His avarice that permitted him not to neglect the leaſt gain, ſuffered him not to conſider that he abandoned a very important affair for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was poſſibly of no moment, as indeed it was not. As ſoon as he got quit from it, he returned to ſeek <hi>Villeflattin,</hi> to ask him if he remembred in what terms the Promiſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage expreſſed it ſelf, ſince it ſeemed he had it in his hands: but he was gone, for being a great ſervant of <hi>Lucrece</hi> and her Relations, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the abrupt departure of <hi>Vollichou,</hi> he thought he made all that haſte to acquaint his Wife and Daughter how they were abuſed, and that another party had got a Promiſe of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> Indeed he thought he went to ſtrike up the Match immediately, before any oppoſition could be made; leſt he came ſhort in a buſineſs that was really advantageous to him.</p>
               <p>This made him on his own head (without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeaking to <hi>Lucrece,</hi> or to her Uncle or Aunt) for fear of loſing time, to put a ſtop to this Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the Curates both of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> and St. <hi>Severin:</hi> Beſides all which, he obtained from the Official a Prohibition of the Bains, and gave notice of this both to the Curates and <hi>Vollichou,</hi> for he knew not <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s Lodging. About 3 Afternoon he came ſweating to tell <hi>Lucrece</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:108350:30"/> he had News for her, that ſhe was not a little beholding to him; that he had neither eat nor drank that day, but continually ran up and down to ſerve her. After many ſuch Prologues he related his rancounter with <hi>Vollichou,</hi> and all the exploits he had afterwards performed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucrece</hi> was very much ſurprized at this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and her Cheeks were died with a bluſh deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ever before. Her thanks to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor were, <hi>That he had indeed ſerved her with great zeal, ſince he had not taken time to mention the buſineſs to her Aunt or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, that for her own part ſhe had little inclination to marry</hi> Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus; <hi>eſpecially to force him to it by Law. Ah!</hi> ſaid the Proctor, <hi>we muſt make ſuch vain youth; know what it is to deceive honeſt maids, we have his hand, and he ſhall at leaſt pay coſts and dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; let me alone to deal with him:</hi> ſo reiterating, <hi>I have neither eat nor drank to day, I will ſee you again;</hi> he ſhut the Chamber door and went down ſtairs, nay he double locked it, for fear they ſhould follow to bring him back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucrece,</hi> whom by good chance he had found alone, was not a little perplexed, her Lord was gone a while before, and had left behind him Pledges of his Love; for ſhe had lately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a certain indiſpoſition, that threatned quickly to ſpoil the neat ſhape of her body: this had obliged her to preſs him to marry; but when ſhe ſo earneſtly conjured him, that he knew not how to excuſe himſelf, he received an Order from the Court to go to his Regiment; which he obeyed, though with a ſeeming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108350:31"/> and not without many proteſtations of returning ſpeedily to make good his promiſe. Well, away he went, but the time he prefixed for coming back I know not certainly, but this I am ſure of, he is not yet come. <hi>Lucrece</hi> writ him many Letters, but received no Anſwer; and then, though too late, perceived ſhe had been abuſed; and the more to confirm her in this opinion, ſhe could not find the Promiſe of Marriage he had given her; nor yet imagine how ſhe had loſt it, conſidering her care in lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in her Cabinet: Thus it happened,</p>
               <p>The Lords paſſion having been a little allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fruition, he reflected on the folly he ſhould be guilty of if he made good his promiſe to <hi>Lucrece.</hi> Beſides the diſparaging his Family, by a miſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becoming Alliance, he apprehended all his Relations incenſed againſt him, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of thoſe Inheritances, without which he could not ſupport the luſtre of his birth; and on the other ſide he was ſenſible that if <hi>Lucrece</hi> ſued him on accompt of the Promiſe of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, it would be a bad buſineſs; for beſides that ſuch Suits ever leave behind them ſome blemiſhes to the honour of a Man of Quality, becauſe they publickly reproach him with infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and breach of promiſe, their events are doubtful, and how happily ſoever one ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s quit of them they are very coſtly; he reſolved by Stratagem to free himſelf from the difficulty in which too violent an affection had engaged him.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:108350:31"/>
               <p>To this purpoſe, he one day carried his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs to St. <hi>Germains</hi> Fair, and telling her he would preſent her the richeſt Ebony Cabinet that was to be found there, deſired her to chuſe it and bargain for it her ſelf; ſhe did both, and over and above gave him thanks for his liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Lord would needs undertake the care of ſending it home, but firſt ſecretly ordered double Keys to be made, of which he kept one himſelf, and ſent the other with the Cabinet to <hi>Lucrece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She had no ſooner received this Preſent, but ſhe put in it all that ſhe had greateſt eſteem for; and amongſt the reſt the Lords Promiſe of Marriage.</p>
               <p>A little before his Journey, he went to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crece</hi>'s Lodging, when he was ſure ſhe was not at home, and familiarly entring, as he had wont to do, and pretending ſome important occaſion of ſpeaking with her, deſired to ſtay for her in her Chamber. He was ſoon left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone there, and then with the Key he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to himſelf, opened the Cabinet, and finding the Promiſe, carried it away. <hi>Lucrece</hi> at her return perceived nothing, nay ſhe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered not the theft, till a little before the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Villeflattin</hi> entred againſt <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and never once ſuſpected the Lord. But his abſence continuing, without writing to her, and the Promiſe of Marriage being loſt, ſhe no longer doubted his infidelity. She had no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at the time of this affliction, but more carefully to cheriſh her other Conqueſts. Now
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108350:32"/> it being very important for her to marry before that which it ſo highly concerned her to conceal, diſcovered it ſelf; ſhe began to be leſs troubled at her Neighbours indiſcreet zeal in getting her a Husband in ſpight of her teeth, by the way of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>She therefore patiently attended the ſucceſs of that affair, reaſoning thus, <hi>That if ſhe got the better of it, ſhe got alſo a Husband, of which ſhe ſtood in great need; and if the worst, ſhe might ſay, as was true, ſhe approved not that proceeding, and that it was commenced without her conſent;</hi> which ſhe thought ſufficient to ſecure her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Neither had ſhe any time to conſider, for the Proctors precipitation having already given ſufficient occaſion to the world to rally and cenſure, ſhe muſt neceſſarily expect the concluſion. <hi>Villeflattin</hi> returning at night, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her for the Promiſe. Shame having as yet not ſuffered her to take any reſolution, ſhe pretended ſhe had miſlaid, and poſſibly loſt it. <hi>That would be very fine,</hi> ſaid he.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But tell me freely, have no other privacies paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between you, hath there been no copulation? Speak boldly, for this may be material to your Suit; on ſuch occaſions we muſt not be ſcrupulous, leaſt we repent, when our Allegations cannot be received.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucrece</hi> bluſhed at this with ſo inexpreſsible diſorder, ſhe knew not how to make any reply; and the ſurprize of this downright expreſsion, made her acknowledge her misfortune; to which by his manner of proceeding, ſhe gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108350:32"/> he was not a ſtranger: ſhe therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to mediate with her Uncle and Aunt for her pardon. <hi>Villeflattin</hi> ſuppoſed ſhe bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe he had too abruptly queſtioned her about a buſineſs, of which he ought to have ſought information more diſcreetly; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther preſſure commended her mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: <hi>Be as wiſe for the future</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>as you have been hitherto, and leave the care of this to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that knew nothing of theſe new accidents, went that very Evening to viſit his true Miſtriſs <hi>Javota,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with clean Linnen and Hair curled and powdred, he arrived in a Sedan, very jocund, turning up his Muſtachio's and ſinging a new air. He found the Mother and Daughter in the Hall, imploied very Citizen-like, in fitting Linnen to compleat the Packet of the Contracted Maid. Their cold Reception ſomewhat ſurprized him, but taking hint for his diſcourſe from the work they were about, <hi>My good Mother-in-law,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>your Daughter is not a little obliged to you, for queſtionleſs you work for her;</hi> to which the other abruptly anſwered, <hi>Yes Sir, for her, but in that you are little concerned; you are extreamly confident to come any more hither, after the affront you have done us: but know my Daughter is young and cannot want a Husband, neither will we commence a Suit in</hi> Doctors Commons <hi>to get a Son-in-law. Go your wayes to your other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs, to whom you have promiſed Marriage, we will not be the occaſions of her diſhonour. Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:108350:33"/> much ſurprized, ſwore he was engaged to none but her Daughter. <hi>As if</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>we had not wherewithal to convince him; Go up</hi> Juliana <hi>and bring down the Paper on the Mantle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree of the Chimney, and then we ſhall ſee how he will look on it.</hi> When it was brought, <hi>Do I ſpeak without Book,</hi> ſaid ſhe. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> almoſt ſwounded in reading it, for knowing <hi>Lucrece</hi> ſo well, he could not imagine her Pride would have condeſcended to ſue a Husband. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred ſhe received the Promiſe rallying, and without grounding any hope or deſign of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age on it: and indeed ſhe had not to that time ever mentioned it; ſo that he thought this was not produced by her order: and therefore told his Mother-in-law, <hi>This is a trick put upon me by my enimies, but if this be all, I will to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bring you a Renunciation of this taken before a Notary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have nothing to do,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>with Notaries nor Renunciations, and will not give my Daughter to a Debauchee and Courter of the Eleven thouſand Virgins; I muſt have one that will make a good Husband and mind getting his living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that found no great ſatisfaction in all this, and beſides impatient till he might know from whence the cauſe of it proceeded, took his leave quickly after: he was not bold e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſalute his Miſtriſs at parting, after the manner of declared Lovers, and <hi>Javota</hi> thought it ſufficient to make him a ſilent Courtſy; but as ſhe aroſe, ſhe let fall a Bottom of Threed and her Ciſſars, that lay in her lap: <hi>Nicodemus</hi> caſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108350:33"/> himſelf headlong at her feet to take them up; <hi>Javota</hi> thought it manners to ſtoop and prevent him, and in this they both ſo well timed their motions, that their Fore-heads knocked with ſuch violence, each retained a bump. <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> ſtark mad at ſuch a misfortune, haſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and not taking notice of a lame Cupboard that was behind him, gave it ſuch a juſtle, that he cauſed to fall from it a fair <hi>China</hi> Veſſel, which (there being no more of them in the Houſe) was eſteemed almoſt equal to the only Daughter. This made the Mother fall to downright ſcolding, and him to his Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of pardons and excuſes; and gathering up the pieces, by them to take his meaſures for ſending ſuch another: but going apace, with new ſhoes, on a floor very well rubb'd, and ſo as it ought to be, in order to <hi>Javota</hi>'s being contracted, his foot ſlipt, and he (as uſually in ſuch accidents, we ſeek help of what is next us) caught hold of the Taſſels of the Strings of a Looking-Glaſs, which the weight of his body breaking, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and the Looking-Glaſs fell together; but the Looking-Glaſs got great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſchief, for it was broken into a thouſand pieces, and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> eſcaped with two or three contuſions, not very conſiderable. The Attorney's Wife cried out lowder than ever, <hi>What have we to do with this Houſe-breaker, this univerſal deſtruction;</hi> and went about to drive him away with a Broom-ſtaffe. <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> ſtrangely in diſorder, got to the door, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamly angry, opened it with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108350:34"/> it ſtruck againſt a Theorbo a Neighbour had ſet againſt the Wall, and broke it in pieces: It was no ſmall happineſs to him that it was Night, for otherwiſe the ſcolding of <hi>Mrs. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney,</hi> would have raiſed an Hue and Cry of Boys to have followed him. Well, away he went, alike inflamed with ſhame and rage, and it being too late to do any thing that Night, reſolved in the Morning to viſit <hi>Lucrece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Morning then, that he might make his Viſit handſomely, he called for his beſt Suit of Laced Linnen, which was brought him the Band excepting, for that was miſsing; he ſent his man to fech it at the Laundreſſes, but ſhe anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe had it not. <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that was a good thrifty Student, ſought it himſelf amongſt all his Linnen, both fowl and clean; and at laſt found as well what he ſought as what he ſought not: but you are firſt to underſtand that this Laundreſs waſhed alſo for the Family where <hi>Lucrece</hi> lived, and was very well acquainted there; amongſt his fowl Linnen he found a Smock in ſome places died in grain, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly asked, <hi>If it belonged to Mrs.</hi> Lucrece? Goody Laundreſs anſwered with a great deal of innocence, <hi>No by my faith Sir, Mrs</hi> Lucrece <hi>is now the cleanlieſt Maid in</hi> Paris, <hi>this Three Moneths day I have not ſeen the leaſt ſpot in her Linnen, but ſhe puts it off in a manner as white as ſhe puts it on. Well, but how does ſhe,</hi> ſaid <hi>Nicodemus? Alas, good Gentlewoman,</hi> ſaid the Laundreſs, <hi>not well: when I go thither a Mornings, I find her ſo ſtrangely troubled with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108350:34"/> Vomitings, Qualms, and Pains at her Heart and Stomack, ſhe cannot endure to be laced; yet ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver complains, and ſo carefully conceals her indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, it is not known to any of the Family. In the Afternoons ſhe entertains company, as if ſhe ailed nothing, and is truly the beſt and patienteſt creature alive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicodemus</hi> very well obſerved the ſimplicity of theſe words, and inſtead of his Viſit to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crece,</hi> went to a Doctor, and one of his Brothers of the Barre, ſuſpecting the truth and more than the whole truth; for he conceited that <hi>Lucrece</hi>'s relations had ſet on foot this Action, to oblige him to marry her, as a remedy for her riſing Belly: he ſuppoſed alſo, that to excuſe her fault, ſhe had informed them he had decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her, with that promiſe of Marriage he had fooliſhly given her. His friends, with whom he adviſed, told him (and he ought to have known it himſelf, it being a point of his Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) <hi>his Cauſe was bad, that a Maid got with Child, on account of a Promiſe of Marriage, would be ſooner believed by the Juſtice than he; and that none of his Oaths could ever deſtroy the preſumption that it was his work. Beſides all which,</hi> Lucrece <hi>was handſom, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count had many Friends in Court, that could make her prevail, were her Cauſe never ſo bad: and yet more, ſhe ſeemed ſo diſcreet, and was ſo crafty, that though her Gallantry were notorious, ſhe could not be convicted of any misdemeanor.</hi> For theſe reaſons he reſolved to quit himſelf of this Affair, before it became too publick, coſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108350:35"/> what it would; for he conceived, that as ſoon as he had allayed this ſtorm, and annulled the oppoſal, he ſhould eaſily ſtrike in again with the Parents of <hi>Javota,</hi> with whom he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately in love; and certainly had this been known, it would have coſt him very dear. He therefore cunningly imployed ſome time by friends to deal under-hand with <hi>Lncrece</hi>'s Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, not daring to go to him in perſon. And this he effected by means of an acquaintance of <hi>Villeflattins,</hi> the Plenipotentiary and Director General of this Affair, that gave a willing ear to his Propoſals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucrece</hi> in the mean time was extreamly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, ſhe continually apprehended her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes becoming publick, and perceiving there was no more hope of the Lord, reſolved to take advantage of the affair, chance and the Proctors raſheſs had preſented; and that which made her the rather give conſent, was, that ſhe had once liſtned to a Conſultation of the ſame kind held at her Uncles, where the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was concluded in favour of a Maid in the like Agony. She therefore took her Promiſe of Marriage, with intention to ſhew it her Uncle, beg his Pardon, and oblige him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair her honour. But alas ſhe had at that very inſtant two ſtrange reluctances, one of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering her fault, the other of accuſing an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, which yet was very neceſſary on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>Thrice went ſhe up to her Uncles Chamber, and thrice came down again without ſaying any
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108350:35"/> thing, but at laſt returning with a better reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſhe began, <hi>Good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle,</hi> but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arely repenting to have begun, concluded; and when her Uncle demanded, <hi>What ſhe would have?</hi> asked, <hi>If he had not ſeen her Ciſſars which ſhe left on the Table?</hi> but after many wheelings ſhe at laſt charged home. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I am deſirous to acquaint you with a certain affair, in which I beſeech you to be favorable to me.</hi> But ſhe had no ſooner begun to explain her ſelf, and withal to bluſh, but her Uncle was called down about buſineſ that required haſte; down he therefore went, and a while after ſent for his Cloak and Gloves. <hi>Lucrece</hi> thought her ſelf very fortunate not to have then begun the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of her adventure, in which ſhe would have been very ſorry to have been interrupted. This Uncle was ſent for by <hi>Villeflattin,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the buſineſs he proſecuted without the others knowledge, and at his own meer and proper motion, becauſe of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary care of all the intereſts of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The good man was much ſurprized a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the News, and thought it very ſtrange his Niece had never ſaid any thing of it to him: but he was more ſurprized, when <hi>Villeflattin</hi> having acquainted him with what he had done, told him the Suit was at an end if he pleaſed: That great damages and advantages were offered, and that <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s Solliciter had been at his Houſe, and proffered to give <hi>Lucrece</hi> Two thouſand Crowns ready down, provided the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs might be made an end of. That he had
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108350:36"/> told him <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did not at all diſtruſt his Cauſe, nor of being able to prove theirs ill grounded; but that he was deſirous to remove the jealouſie it gave the Parents of <hi>Javota,</hi> whom he was about to marry: and more eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the time in which Weddings were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, being near expiring, he was loath to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer delays. In a word, that he ſacrificed this money to his ſatisfaction, and to prevent loſs of that moſt precious time; and in another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture would not have done it. <hi>Villeflattin</hi> who had been promiſed a handſom gratuity, knew ſo well how to cajole the good old man, he brought him to an acceptance of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, not without menaces that in caſe of delay, the proffer would be revoked the next day, and then they muſt go to Law in earneſt. But that which moved him more, was <hi>Villeflattins</hi> cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that <hi>Lucrece</hi> could not find her Promiſe of Marriage, for want whereof they ſhould quickly be non-ſuited; wiſhing him alſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that <hi>Lucrece</hi> pretending to no more but a ſimple Promiſe, and a Solemn Contract having been made with <hi>Javota,</hi> the Law would afford only Coſts and Damages, which ſeldom amount to any thing conſiderable, and depend meerly on the humor of the Judges.</p>
               <p>A Conference therefore was agreed on, in which it was not neceſſary that <hi>Lucrece</hi> ſhould be a Speaker, being under age and having an Uncle that very well underſtood her intereſts. He accepted there the Two thouſand Crowns, which ſtood him in good ſtead afterwards, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108350:36"/> went preſently with the good News to <hi>Lucrece,</hi> and <hi>Villeflattin</hi> bawled it out as ſoon as he came at her door, <hi>Did I not tell you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I would get you Coſts and Damages? here I have brought you Two thouſand Crowns, yet had not the Promiſe of Marriage in my hands; imagine what that might have produced, had you not loſt it: might you have had you will, all had come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; Chuſe whether you will thank me or no, but I do little leſs than give you this Money. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crece</hi> ſurpriz'd at the Complement, and more at the concluſion than beginning of the Suit, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in ſuch a manner as expreſſed a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous contempt of riches, pretending ſhe would not out live it, and that ſhe had diſapproved the whole proceeding: She thanked him neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for his good will, and that very night ſent him a ſumme of money as a reward for the pains he had taken, which he generouſly refuſed; and next day made him a Preſent of thrice the value, which he courteouſly received, <hi>Lucrece</hi> was now no longer concerned to publiſh her ſecret indiſpoſition, but to find new inventions for concealing it, which ſhe did, as you ſhall know hereafter: but it is beſt to let her reſt a while, it being incivil to be too long trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to a Maid that is with-child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicodemus</hi> very glad to have thus purchaſed his quiet went immediately to <hi>Javota</hi>'s Father, yet not before he had pacified her Mother, by ſending her another Looking-Glaſs, another Theorbo, and another <hi>China</hi> Veſſel; but <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lichou</hi> received him not ſo cheerfully as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108350:37"/> not much valuing the renunciation of the oppoſal; and under pretence that he which had been guilty of one folly, might probably have committed many other, demanded time to make enquiry, and therefore would have the Wedding deferred, which <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was fain to ſuffer, yet not without regret of the money he had paid in hope of being ſuddenly married. This yet was not the reaſon of <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lichou</hi>'s delay, but becauſe a day or two before a more advantageous Match had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for his Daughter, and that he might have (as he called it) two Strings to his Bow, and if he could engage with the more wealthy, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately break off with the other.</p>
               <p>The other Gallant propounded for <hi>Javota</hi> was alſo an Advocate, or at leaſt one that went to the Hall in a Bar Gown, though the only time he ever appeared there was when he took his Oath to obſerve the Rules, and the truth is he obſerved them very well, for the never had occaſion to break them. In twenty years he never miſſed the Hall one Morning in Term time, yet no body ever took his Council, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied him to draw a Bill, or plead: but inſtead of theſe he walked ſtill up and down the Hall very buſie in diſcourſing falſe News and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Politicks, cenſuring the Government, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch other idle perſons, as take upon them to be State Controllers, Officers in great requeſt, and which I wonder are not taxed in the <hi>Subſidy-Book;</hi> in the Afternoons he went to hear Lectures, Mountebanks, and to all other
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108350:37"/> Publick Diverſions that coſt nothing: for ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice had an abſolute dominion over him, and was a quality he derived from his Father (who was a Haberdaſher) with his inheritance. He was grown very rich by ſparing his Money, and very grave by ſparing his Beard; his Name was <hi>John Bedou,</hi> ſhort of ſtature and grey, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what flat-noſed and broad-ſhouldered. His Chamber was a Cabinet of Antiquities, not in regard of any particular Curioſities, but of all its Furniture. His Table and Cupboard were ingraven with ancient Figures, ſo tender and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate (I mean the Table and Cupboard) it would have been impoſſible for them to have ſuffered removal, without packeting in Cotton or Straw, like Earthen Ware. His Stools and Hangings were ſeveral pieces, every one of them ſo conſiderable it had not its fellow. Over his Chimney were placed two or three Fire Arms, which had ruſted there ever ſince the time of the League. At the Beam went croſs his Roof hung Cages of Birds taught by himſelf to ſing and whiſtle.</p>
               <p>But the only thing in which he pretended to be profuſive, was a Library conſiſting of Choice Books, for he was very careful to ſelect ſuch as were cheapeſt. The ſeveral Tomes of one and the ſame Author, were of different Volumes, Impreſſions, and Bindings, and ever imperfect.</p>
               <p>He avoided to come in good company, out of apprehenſion it might coſt him Money, and broke off from a Soceity, where was very good
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108350:38"/> diſcourſe, that might have been inſtructive to him, becauſe at the years end he ſhould have paid Half a Crown for ſome ſmall conveniences, and to a poor man that made clean the room. He thought this preſent too exceſſive, but was willing to give Sixpence, which with no ſmall pains, and having turned his Pocket, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with many other Trinkets, he at laſt drew out, and amongſt the reſt a good handful of Crums of Bread, which made ſome rally him, and ſay he had on purpoſe put theſe amongſt his Money, to keep it from ruſting, as Knives ſeldom usſd are kept bright in bran: this rupture was ſatisfactory enough to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for they perceived his Brain was like a Pumice Stone, and could not poſſibly be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
               <p>He wanted not yet ſome good qualities, for he was chaſte and ſober in an eminent degree, and no leſs poſſeſſed of all thrifty vertues. He was very baſhful, which might have become him had he been young. He could not look on a woman without bluſhing like a Cherubim, and he was ſo very ſhamefaced, that ſtill whileſt he talked to one he looked on another, playing with his Buttons or Bandſtrings; ſometimes gnawing his Gloves, and ſcratching where it itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not; in a word, he had not the leaſt aſſurance in his Meen. His Clothes were no leſs ridiculous than it, they were Memorials of all Modes that had ever been in vogue in <hi>France.</hi> His Hat and Head were alike pointed; his Shoes flat, and the ſoles as even as the Floor: He never appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108350:38"/> Faſhions, but when little Bands, little Skirts, and Strait Breeches were in uſe; theſe becauſe they ſpared Stuff, he was very Opinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in adhering to; his Hair was fat, though his Face was lean; and his Beard and Eyebrows ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well grown, conſidering how ſlenderly they were fed.</p>
               <p>It was pity a Plant ſo excellent and ſingular in its kind, produced no Ciens, he therefore ſpoke of marrying, or rather ſome body elſe ſpoke of it for him; for he was a man to marry as Princes uſe to do, by an Ambaſſador; as greatneſs obliges thoſe, ſo did baſhfulneſs him. In order yet to this, he had a mind to play the Gallant, and to viſit now and then his Neighbors, and that ſo friendlily, that they ſupped together on Sunday and Holyday Nights, every one ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Diſh; where it once pleaſantly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened there came in eight Shoulders of Mutton from eight ſeveral Families, that made up the Company. But his greateſt expence was at the <hi>Carneval,</hi> when he as well as the reſt, feaſted in his turn.</p>
               <p>I muſt needs tell a little Story that happened at one of theſe neighbourly good Fellowſhips, a Scrivenors Wife uſed to lock up her Bread af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had cut ſome ſlices for her Prentices and Maids Suppers, and one Night feaſting amongſt her Neighbours, had forgotten to leave them out their Luncheons, ſo that an Apprentiſe was deputed to go to her for the Key of the Cupboard, who demanded it aloud amongſt all the Company. She bluſhed, but knew not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108350:39"/> how to refuſe it; but when ſhe came home, ſoundly reprehended his indiſcretion, expreſly forbidding him any more to ask her for the Key of the Cupboard when ſhe was in Company; he forgot not this, and when afterwards the like default of memory happened to her, publickly told her, <hi>Miſtriſs, Since you will not have me ask for the Key of the Cupboard, pray be pleaſed to open it your ſelf;</hi> and then called in the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that brought it on his back.: a while after a ſmall incident of the Kitchin gave another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for laughter. A Barber of the Knot, that pretended great skil in Sauces, undertook to make a <hi>Salmegoudis;</hi> but having ſet in on aſhes a little too hot, melted the brims of the diſh juſt ſo much as to make it fit to trim withal.</p>
               <p>Theſe rancounters happened very luckily for <hi>Bedout</hi> at his houſe, giving occaſion for its being talked on.</p>
               <p>This frequent good cheer made him reſolve to marry in earneſt, he therefore began to trick up himſelf, got his Hat blockt and glazed, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Locks and put on Cuffs and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>He alſo fell'd the timber of his Beard and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood of his Eyebrows, and after much pains became leſs hideous than before. A Couſin of his, that was a Neighbour of <hi>Javota</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, propounded this Advocate, all whoſe Charmes were un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108350:39"/> Husband, and neither ſpend his own nor his Wives fortune. But <hi>Vollichou</hi> being a great formaliſt, ſaid, he muſt ſee the particulars of his Eſtate, and deſired a Memorial.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Bedout</hi> abſolutely refuſed, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of danger of being raiſed in the <hi>Subſidy-Book</hi> to avoid which he had formerly abſented himſelf Six Moneths; that they which levied it had ſpies every where, and getting ſight of his Memorial, might renew their proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He therefore thought it enough to ſay, <hi>He would produce as much as ſhould be laid down with the Maid propoſed for him.</hi> His Eſtate being real, and conſiſting in houſes in the City and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, <hi>Lorenca</hi> (for that was his Coſins Name) prevailed ſo far that formality was no longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on; but ſhe found much more difficulty in bringing him and the Miſtriſs ſhe deſigned him to meet, and ſee how they liked each other; for <hi>Bedout</hi> ſtill evaded all appointments, ſaying there was no haſte of that, for he would not chuſe a Wife for her beauty, that it was time enough to ſee her when the buſineſs was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on, and that he never queſtioned be what ſhe would, but he ſhould like her; But what if ſhe likes not you, ſaid <hi>Lorenca? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dou</hi> replied, <hi>An honeſt Woman ought to have no eyes for the defects of her husband.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe brutalities the buſineſs went on, and ſo far, that <hi>Lorenca</hi> reſolved, fall back fall edge, to bring them together: She therefore invited her Coſin to her houſe on a certain day, when ſhe knew Mrs. <hi>Vollichou</hi> with her
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108350:40"/> Daughter were to viſit her. He came, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the ambuſh laid for him, and after a while ſeeing two Women that he knew not enter, bluſhed, and was out of countenance, and would by all means be gone; but <hi>Lorenca</hi> laying hold on his arm, ſaid, <hi>Stay Coſin, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is not a little favorable to you to day, here is your future Wife and Mother in Law;</hi> this put him yet more out of countenance, but ſtay he muſt: ſo he made two legs, one to the right the other to the left, to each of them one; leaving it to his Coſin, becauſe Miſtris of the houſe, to ſpeak for him.</p>
               <p>Being ſeated not far from <hi>Javota,</hi> having put his Hat under his arm and rubbed his hands; after a competent ſilence, you may ſuppoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he ſhould ſay, he thus began the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; <hi>Well Miſtriſs, Are you ſhe I have been ſpoken to about? Javota</hi> with her wonted innocence anſwered, <hi>I know not whether you have been ſpoken to about me, but I know very well that I have not been ſpoken to about you. How,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>do they pretend to marry you without your knowledge? I cannot tell,</hi> ſaid ſhe. <hi>But what would you ſay,</hi> quoth he, <hi>in caſe a Marriage were propounded to you? I would ſay nothing,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Javota. That,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bedou</hi> aloud (thinking he was witty) <hi>were to my advantage; for our Laws in formal terms declare, That ſilence gives conſent. I know not your Laws,</hi> quoth ſhe, <hi>nor any other but thoſe of my Father and Mother. But,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if they ſhould command you to love a Lad like me, would you do it? No,</hi> ſaid <hi>Javota,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108350:40"/> for Maids ought not to love Men. I mean,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bedout, if he were your Husband. That,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>will not be yet, and a great deal of water will paſs under the Bridge before that time.</hi> The good Mother, that had a mind to this match, as thinking it very advantageous, ſtruck in and ſaid, <hi>I pray Sir give no great regard to her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſhe is young, and ſo innocent it comes near ſimplicity. Say not ſo Miſtriſs,</hi> replied <hi>Bedou, ſhe is your Daughter, and muſt needs reſemble you; for my own part I have ever thought it beſt to take a Wife that is very young, for before ſhe hath acquired habits, one may faſhion her as he liſts.</hi> The Mother immediately ſaid, <hi>My Daughter hath been ever vertuouſly brought up, and I will deliver her to her Husband a good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, from morning to night her eyes are never off her work. Javota</hi> then demanded, <hi>What must I work after I am married? I thought when I came to be Miſtriſs, I ſhould have no more to do, but pleaſe my ſelf, go abroad and make Viſits? If it be ſo, I had as live continue as I am, to what purpoſe is Marriage? Lorenca</hi> very ſubtilly and maliciouſly told her, <hi>No, no, Miſtriſs, be not afraid, my Coſin is a braver man than you take him for, he hath wherewithal to maintain you gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly, without your giving your ſelf any care or trouble; you will live eaſily and pleaſantly, all the Fore-noons you may ſleep, and all the Afternoons play at Cards or make Viſits; if you be at home at Dinner and Supper it is ſufficient. You have no Letter of Attorney to authoriſe you to ſay this,</hi> quoth <hi>Bedou,</hi> ſomewhat in choler: <hi>A Husband
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108350:41"/> marries a Wife, that ſhe may be his Companion, and guide his houſe; and inſtead of huſwifing his goods, ſhall ſhe ſquander them? the wealth of</hi> Croeſus <hi>were not ſufficient for this. I muſt deal freely, I would have a Wife after my own faſhion, that ſhould pleaſe her ſelf in nothing but looking on her Husband. You extreamly confine her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lorenca. But,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bedou, I will prove by infinite authorities that this ought to be ſo;</hi> with that he began to blunder out a hundred follies and pendantries, when very luckily for him a Collation was brought into the Hall, that interrupted this ridiculous Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The only Gallantry he attempted that day, was to pare an Apple for his Miſtriſs, which having almoſt finiſhed, it ſlipt thorow his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and ſugared it ſelf on the Floor; he took it up with a Fork, blew upon it, and wiped it a little, and then offered it her; telling her as many fools uſe to do, <hi>That he begged a thouſand pardons Javota</hi> ſillily anſwered, <hi>Sir, I can give you none, becauſe I have none.</hi> After other the like diſcourſes and like adventures, the Viſit ended. <hi>Bedou</hi> adventured to bring his Miſtriſs home, and in the way ſtill took the Wall, not out of pride you muſt imagine nor incivility, but ignorance: very excuſable in one that was but a Novice in the Art of Squiring, and that never was in poſſibility of ſuch a fault before. He was no ſooner gone, but <hi>Javota</hi> ſaid to her Mother, <hi>Good God, Mother, I cannot abide this man:</hi> who anſwered, <hi>Peace little Baggage, you underſtand not your own good.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:108350:41"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bedou</hi> in his way home called at his Coſins, who asked, <hi>What he ſaid of ſo pretty a Maid?</hi> and he replied, <hi>He found no fault but that ſhe was too pretty:</hi> and as timerous perſons are ever diſtruſtful and jealous, acknowledged, <hi>That if ſhe happened to be his Wife, he ſhould have a great deal of trouble to look after her.</hi> But the power of Beauty making ſenſible impreſſions on the moſt rude and ſavage, he was ſmitten, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought his Coſin to continue her endeavours to bring this Marriage to a ſpeedy effect. In the mean time he hoped to approve himſelf a better Courtier in his Cloſet, by writing to his Miſtriſs ſomething premeditated, than in a perſonal and <hi>ex tempore</hi> ſpeaking to her; becauſe his baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs many times interrupted his Expreſſions. He went to work therefore very ſeriouſly, and after he had ſcribled Nonſenſe enough to make a Love-Letter and writ it out fair in Gilt Paper, and ſealed it, very neatly bound about with Silk (a curioſity he had never made uſe of before) gave it to a Porter worthy of ſuch an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: who being charged to deliver it into Mrs <hi>Javota's</hi> own hands, did that, but no more; for he told her nothing, neither whence it came nor who it was for: neither did ſhe ask any thing but <hi>Whether the Poſte were paid?</hi> and ſo immediately carried it up to her Father, to whom ſhe conceived it was directed; for ſhe had often received Letters for him, but never any for her ſelf: ſo that ſhe never minded the Superſcription, though I will not poſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it had one. <hi>Vollichou</hi> opened and read it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108350:42"/> ſmiling at his Daughters ſimplicity, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the incomparable wit of him he deſigned for his Son-in-law, with the magnificence and ſingularity of his Stile. The Porter therefore came back without any anſwer, and being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to give any account how his Embaſſy had been received; <hi>Bedou</hi> reſolved to go in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Had he gone alone, he had peradventure fared no better than <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> but of this there was little danger, and it was no ſmall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the violence of his paſſion, that he durſt adventure, though ſo well and ſecurely convoyed: he therefore beſought his Coſin to return Mrs <hi>Vollichou</hi> her Viſit, and to accept of him for her Gentleman-Uſher. <hi>Lorenca</hi> was over-joyed to ſerve him in this, and that her Coſin was ſo much altered, not imagining he would ever have had the confidence to viſit his Miſtriſs. She was very well received both by Mother and Daughter, and for her ſake <hi>Bedou</hi> alſo. Being leſs fine than <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing of the meen of a dangerous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joller, Mrs <hi>Vollichou</hi> did not at all apprehend leaving him with her Daughter, whileſt ſhe chatted with <hi>Lorenca,</hi> who had purpoſely drawn her aſide, to favour the attempts of this Lover. <hi>Bedou</hi> impatient to learn the ſucceſs of his great effort of wit, amongſt his firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements asked <hi>Javota, What ſhe thought of his Letter, and why ſhe returned no anſwer?</hi> She coolly replied. <hi>She ſaw no Letter but one for her Father, which ſhe gave him, and he would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by the Poſt. I ſpeak not of that,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108350:42"/> of one I ſent to day by a Porter to your ſelf. To me,</hi> cried out <hi>Javota,</hi> all amazed, <hi>do Maids receive Letters? Are not Letters written about buſineſs? Beſides, from whom ſhould it come? I took the boldneſs to ſend it,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bedou. You,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>you are not in the Countrey; do you take me for ſuch a Fool, that I know not that Letters are brought from a great way off by Poſts and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers? We receive many daily, and my Father as often complains of the Portage. Beſides, to what purpoſe were it to write to me? Can you not as well, when you come hither, tell me what you have to ſay to me, without ſending? Bedou,</hi> that thought his Letter incomparable, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected infinite commendations, caught hold of her words; <hi>Since therefore</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know the contents of my Letter, I will read it to you, for I have kept a Copy, and then took out of his Pocket what he read in the following terms.</hi>

               <p>After <hi>Javota</hi> had very ſeriouſly liſtned to this Letter, and underſtood nothing of it, ſhe thought it to be for want of attention, and therefore prayed <hi>Bedou</hi> to read it again, which he did very willingly, taking this to be a token of the excellency of the Piece; but when he came to the word <hi>Allegory</hi> ſhe interrupted with a loud cry, <hi>O heavens, what a great abominable word is this! is there no miſchief in it?</hi> and when he went about to interpret it, ſhe cried, <hi>No, no, I will not know it, it is ſufficient my Mother hath alwayes forbidden me to hear ſuch groſs words;</hi> and then without minding him any more, went to her Mother; ſo that <hi>Bedou</hi> for want of other imployment was fain to help <hi>Javota</hi> to pick Wool.</p>
               <p>Whileſt this laſted Madam <hi>Vellichou</hi> extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tormented poor <hi>Lorenca,</hi> who had wit and knew the world. She had already lamented the care and trouble brought with Children, and the difficulty of getting good Maids; ſhe had asked if ſhe knew ere a good one, becauſe ſhe had reſolved to turn hers away; not without accuſing her of all her faults, and regretting the good qualities of her ſhe had before. She had alſo complained of the charge of Houſe-keeping, and exceſſive price of Victualls, bringing it ſtill in as the burthen of her Song, <hi>That a Family hath a very wide throat, and ſometimes that it is a Gulph and an Abiſs.</hi> But <hi>Lorenca</hi> to change this home-ſpun talk, began to mention ſome Women of the Neighbourhood, and amongſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108350:44"/> the reſt an <hi>Exchequer</hi> mans Wife, that lived o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againſt her. <hi>Name her not to me,</hi> cried Mrs <hi>Vollichou, ſhe is a proud Minx I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; ſhe hath twice given me occaſions of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I will never forgive her. Lorenca</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after the quality of theſe injuries, found they were becauſe the Exchequereſs had not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited Mrs <hi>Vollichou</hi> when ſhe lay in, nor invited her at <hi>Christmaſs.</hi> Whileſt <hi>Lorenca</hi> laughed at this pleaſant reſentment, <hi>Vollichou</hi> came into the Chamber, He had been deboſhing all day, at a Play and the Tavern, where one of his Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents had treated him. His ſatisfaction to have ſaved a Meal, joyned to the fumes of the Wine, made him frolick above what was uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and this was the reaſon he ſhut not himſelf up in his Study to write till Midnight, as he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do. He was ſcarce entred, wben pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and extreamly tranſported, he ſaid, he had been at the fineſt Play that was ever ſeen, and there was ſuch a Crowd it was hard to get in: He ſaid, There were many Printers, or Fellows that got their living by the Preſs. This Clinch was not underſtood at firſt, but he explained it, telling them he meant Cut-purſes, and that a Watch had been loſt in the Crowd. <hi>Lorenca</hi> asked what Piece had been acted. <hi>I will tell you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thus the Caſe ſtood, One called</hi> Cinna, <hi>plotted to kill an Emperour, and to that purpoſe made a League offenſive and defenſive with another called</hi> M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108350:44"/> Sentences imaginable. There was alſo an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in a Chair, before whom thoſe Gallants pleaded admirably, and with very good arguments, the Piece is full of Intrigues that would raviſh you; for concluſion, the Emperour ſigns their Pardons, and they remain as good Friends as Pigs in litter. It is pity,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lorenca, you are not employed to write Prologues, you would take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably, in opening the Plot of a Tragedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The arrival of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> interrupted them, whom <hi>Vellichou,</hi> by reaſon of the good humor he was in, received better than he had wont, though in his heart he intended to break with him; waiting only till ſome of his vanities gave the occaſion; neither could he well be refuſed acceſs to his Miſtriſs, as long as his Engagement with her (I mean his Contract) was in being.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as this Lover had made his Legs, he ſaid to Mrs <hi>Vollichou, Have you not given me a General</hi> Amneſty <hi>of all that is paſt? What would you be at,</hi> replied ſhe very briskly <hi>with your</hi> Amneſty? <hi>I mean,</hi> ſaid <hi>Nicodemus, that I hope that you have drowned all my faults in the River of Oblivion, and what prejudice ſoever I have been occaſion of I am ready to make repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>That is not it troubles me,</hi> quoth Mrs <hi>Volli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chou, but becauſe you are deboſht and naught.</hi> The Husband alſo addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will take care you be examined, for I am told you live ill. Nicodemus</hi> went about to juſtifie himſelf, ſwearing, <hi>He was never guilty
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108350:45"/> of any Crime,</hi> when <hi>Lorenca</hi> ſeeing <hi>Vollichou</hi> ſwoln with laughter, thus interpreted the Quibble <hi>I perceive well,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>by Mr.</hi> Vollichou's <hi>Meen that he reproaches you for not keeping a good houſe. He may when he pleaſe come and make experience of the contrary; for whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will do me that honour, I will entertain him to his ſatisfaction. Well,</hi> ſaid <hi>Vollichou, I take you at your word, I will dine with you to morrow and bring wherewithal to eat. There will be no need of that,</hi> ſaid <hi>Nicodemus, the Market is good, and I will not let you ſtarve. Lorenca</hi> interpreted the ſecond ſmile of <hi>Volli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chou</hi> as ſhe had done the former; <hi>It is not,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that he intends to carry any thing to adde to your Table; but the meaning is, he will carry his teeth the inſtruments wherewith he eats. In good time,</hi> ſaid <hi>Nicodemus, I will expect you to morrow with your friend:</hi> this he ſaid, pointing at <hi>Bedou,</hi> whom he had ſeen at the Hall, and thought had come along with <hi>Vollichou,</hi> not once imagining him to be his Rival. <hi>Bedou</hi> thanked him, but told him he was one that loved not to be chargeable to his friends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out occaſion. <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid <hi>Vollichou, I will ſtand for both, I will eat for him and my ſelf. Brag not of your eating,</hi> ſaid <hi>Nicodemus, leſt the common reproach of Attorneys touch you, which is, That you are great devourers. There is little ground for that,</hi> quoth <hi>Vollichou, for our Trade is very much fallen. It is true,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bedou, an Attorneys Fee is but ſmall, but they have ſo many tricks to augment and cauſe it to be reiterated, it
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108350:45"/> amounts to vaſt ſums; I wonder they are ſuffered, for many of them have raiſed great fortunes in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little time. Bedou</hi> went about to moralize very abundantly on the abuſes of Attorneys, for on ſuch occaſions he was a great diſcourſer, though dumb on thoſe of Gallantry. When <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that left no ſtone unrolled to bring <hi>Javota</hi> into the converſation, ſeeing her divide a Bottom of Yarn, ſaid very poetically, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I behold one of the Three fatal Sisters divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Thred of Life, and my Destiny intirely depending on you, it ſeems to be mine own; which gives me every moment apprehenſion leaſt your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain cut it off. I understand you not,</hi> ſaid <hi>Javo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, I have no deſtiny in my hands, nor any thing but a Bottom of Worſted for my Tapeſtry. How,</hi> ſaid <hi>Nicodemus, do you not deſign to cauſe me to die a thouſand times over, by thoſe cruel delays that retard my felicity; for when I look on the Tapiſtry in your hand, methinks it is</hi> Penelope's Web. <hi>I know not,</hi> replied <hi>Javota, how your</hi> Penelope's Webs <hi>are woven, neither have I ever ſeen any of them to be ſold in</hi> Paris.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Vollichou,</hi> who had an ear to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, interpoſed, <hi>By my faith all this is to little purpoſe, I will prevent your gaining ground till I have made other enquiries. See,</hi> ſaid her Husband, <hi>ſhe is yet no farther than the Examiners Office, but I care not if ſhe paſs thorow all the Courts, provided ſhe avoid the Common Pleas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Lorenca, your Wife is too much a Woman of honour, to give you any diſtruſt on that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108350:46"/> account. I believe ſo,</hi> ſaid <hi>Vollichou, but theſe thrifty Huſwifes are much to be doubted of, who get their Husbands Creſts without paying Fees to the Heralds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You would have been very famous in the time of the Old Teſtament</hi> (ſaid <hi>Nicodemus) you ſpeak all by Figures. His words,</hi> then replied <hi>Bedou, are not to be taken but in a Tropological ſenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lorenca, long admired his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking, he hath certainly a Dictionary of Quibbles, which he hath gotten by heart, he could not elſe be ſo prodigal of them. I know many more,</hi> quoth <hi>Vollichou, for which I take no money;</hi> and went about to be very profuſe of them, had not a little Child come to his Siſter <hi>Javota,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her aloud with ſome preſſing neceſſities. The converſation was interrupted by this, and and had been ſo, had it been a hundred times more ſerious. For it is the Cuſtom of ſuch People to have their Children evermore in their eyes, to make them the chief ſubjects of their diſcourſe, to admire their follies, and ſwallow their ordures. Little <hi>Toinon</hi> was immediately commended for his cleanlineſs, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt promiſed a fine thing; after which Mrs <hi>Vollichou</hi> entertained Mrs <hi>Lorenca</hi> with no other diſcourſe but of her Son; and thought it not enough to talk only of him, but alſo commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another that was yet at the Breſt; ſaying, <hi>It ſpoke without teaching, and very eloquently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Toinon</hi> in the mean time entred the Hall like a Trooper, that is, with a Hobby-horſe between his Legs, and <hi>Vollichou</hi> putting a Broom-ſtick
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108350:46"/> between his, met him; and this <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was pleaſed to call a tilting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lorenca</hi> could not hold from laughing at <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lichou</hi>'s folly, but <hi>Bedou</hi> remonſtrated ſhe was in the wrong to except againſt that action, and that if ſhe had read <hi>Plutarch,</hi> ſhe would have underſtood that <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was once ſurpriſed in the ſame poſture, who inſtead of excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, only deſired thoſe that had ſeen it, not to cenſure him till they had Children of their own. <hi>Lorenca</hi> made only this anſwer. <hi>That nothing could be done but an example of it might be found in Antiquity;</hi> and her diſcretion alone prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her laughing at <hi>Vollichou</hi> to his face: yet within her ſelf ſhe could not but reflect on the fondneſs of thoſe that in the beſt company thus cokes their Children, and think to be excuſed by alledging their paternal affection, as if there were not time enough to ſatisfie it in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Families, and as if the reſt of the company, not obliged by the ſame affection, could have a ſhare in that diverſion: a folly which hath no other excuſe but the example alledged by <hi>Bedou</hi> very impertinently; for <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> pleaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that manner only in private, and was out of countenance when ſurpized in the Action.</p>
               <p>The reſt of this Viſit was paſſed over in the like fopperies, ſo that <hi>Lorenca</hi> very weary roſe up and took her Coſin with her. Neither might <hi>Nicodemus</hi> tarry any longer, becauſe Mrs <hi>Volli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chou</hi> was going to bed, and alwayes uſed to lay the Key under her Pillow. Theſe two Lovers
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108350:47"/> made very many other Viſits no leſs ridiculous, but I have troubled my ſelf too long already with their repetition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his buſineſs all this while fell from bad to wonſe, and <hi>Bedou</hi>'s grew better and better, not that he had any greater ſhare in his Miſtriſs favor; for <hi>Javota</hi> had an equal indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or rather averſion for them both; but becauſe <hi>Vollichou</hi> found <hi>Bedou</hi> had a better eſtate and leſs vanity and folly than <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> he therefore in himſelf fully determined to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her to <hi>Bedou,</hi> without once conſulting his Daughter, deferring to ſign Articles only till diſ-engaged from <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> with whom he hoped ſuddenly to break off.</p>
               <p>There being now no queſtion but <hi>Javota</hi> ſhould be quickly married, ſince ſhe was in hand with two Servants; they began to allow her ſomething more liberty than before. A Dancing Maſter came to faſhion her, and for this they made choice of him that taught the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: and her Mother would eſpecially have her learn the <hi>Cinque Pace</hi> and <hi>Sellingers Round,</hi> which had been danced at her Wedding, and were in her opinion excellent above all others. They alſo permitted her to go into company, but not beyond the Neighbourhood; for they would not truſt her out of their ſight. <hi>Lorenca</hi> who made one in one of the beſt of theſe Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, introduced her. She was well received on accompt of her beauty, notwithſtanding her innocence and ſimplicity; for a fair Perſon gives great luſtre to an Aſſembly of Women. Moſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108350:47"/> of the parties that compoſed it, were ambitious to be reckoned amongſt the Wits and the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, and not any one of them that made not her ſelf remarkable by ſome particular Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</p>
               <p>Their Meetings were at <hi>Angelica</hi>'s, a Perſon of great worth, who (I know not on what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) had engaged amongſt them. She would not yet be new chriſtned, nor take upon her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Romantick Name (as the faſhion is) than her own, for <hi>Angelica</hi> is as paſſable in Verſe and Proſe as any other, and as eminent both in Hiſtory and Fable) She had learned ſome Languages and read all manner of good Books, but ſhe concealed this as if it had been a Crime. She was not ambitious of making Parade of her Conceptions, which were ever very rationall, yet almoſt ever contradicted; for the number of knowing Perſons being weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in that Aſſembly, ſhe was ſtill caſt by plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Voices: on accompt of which ſhe uſed to compare her ſelf to <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believed when ſhe ſpake truth. A Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of hers was the true reverſe of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal. She was Daughter to a Paymaſter of the Army, who to ſpeak more properly ought rather to be called Receiver, for the other part he executed very remiſly. Her true Name was <hi>Philipote,</hi> but her Romantick one <hi>Hippolita,</hi> which is the Anagram of the other; no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable good fortune for a pretended Heroine, when the Letters of her Chriſtian Name afford a Romantick one. She affected to appear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108350:48"/> with moſt inſupportable Pedantry. One of her Suitors taught her Latin, another Italian, a third Chiromancy, a fourth to make Verſes, ſo that ſhe had in a manner as many Maſters as Servants.</p>
               <p>In this Company were perſons of ſeveral qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, but the moſt accompliſhed was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Philalethe,</hi> a paſſionate Admirer of the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Vertues of <hi>Angelica,</hi> and that uſed all means poſſible to gain her good opinion. On the other ſide a certain Author called <hi>Charoſelles</hi> made one, he had gained ſome reputation in his youth, but was then ſo cried down, there was not any Stationer that would print what he writ. Inſtead of this he gave himſelf the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of reading, or at leaſt attempting to read his Works in all Companies, and—but fair and ſoftly, ſhould I go particularly to all his qualities, and thoſe of the other Perſonages, I ſhould make too long a Digreſſion, and too long delay the Wedding we are providing for. To be ſhort, there met daily at <hi>Angilica</hi>'s ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Company, who ſometime controverted Queſtions of much Curioſity, and endeavoured to imitate all that paſſes in the rich Alcoves of Ladies of the higheſt Order.</p>
               <p>On the day of <hi>Javota</hi>'s admittance into this Company, it was but thin, and not ſo tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as uſually. It happened alſo that the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment was ſublime and agreeable, to which though <hi>Javota</hi> contributed only by her preſence, it will not be amiſs to inſert here a part, which ſhe liſtned to with moſt remarkable attention.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108350:48"/> To make this Digreſſion excuſable, whilſt it laſts, imagine if you pleaſe that it happens here as in other Romances, that <hi>Javota</hi> is gone to Sea, that a Storm caſts her on a forrain Shore, or that ſome Raviſher hath carried her to parts ſo remote, we cannot in a long time hear from her.</p>
               <p>After the firſt Complements, with which the ſimpleſt uſually come off well enough, ſince they for the moſt part conſiſt only in a low Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and a <hi>Gallimaufry</hi> pronounced between the teeth, in ſuch manner that nothing of it can he heard; <hi>Hippolita</hi> that pleaſed her ſelf only in learned Diſcourſes, ſoon diverted them from the Vulgar Entertinaments of ordinary Viſits; and ſhe blamed <hi>Lorenca</hi> for having begun to talk of the News of the Town and Neighbourhood; telling her, that ſmells of the Viſit of a Woman that lies in, and the tattle of Goſſips; that in good Companies Books only and high Notions were to be admitted. She immediately fell on the Jacket of certain poor Authors, who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the firſt that ſuffer by theſe <hi>Virtuoſa</hi>'s, when their critical humor poſſeſſes them. Aſſure your ſelves they were then paid home, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me that I ſilently paſs over this Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for I dare not name any Author that is alive, who would probably accuſe me of all that was then ſpoken, though without my abetting. It were to little purpoſe (in my excuſe) to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve all the Sentences that had been given againſt them, the very mentioning them would be looked on as a Capital Crime. They would
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108350:49"/> uſe me worſe than an Hiſtorian or Gazettier, who are not obliged to juſtifie all the paſſages they relate. Beſides that, theſe Gallants are ſo quickly moved, that the leaſt raillery or faint commendation puts them in heat, and makes them your irreconcilable enemies; after which they are mute as to all the renown they before beſtowed upon you: and this to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Stationer that is concerned in the Vent of a Book. I have too great reſpect for them, to uſe them as ſome Writers do, who ſpeaking of them only invert their Names, haſh or anagrammatize them, which is to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for if the Names be well diſguiſed, the Diſcourſe is obſcure, without force or orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or at leaſt can pleaſe but very few; and if they be diſcoverable (as they almoſt ever are) to what purpoſe ſerves the diſguiſe; Readers uſually finding wayes to get the Key: beſides that, ſometimes Pilferers of honour make falſe ones. I will not therefore ſpeak a word to particulars, but only of what was ſaid in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, at which none can take exceptions, if he be not of a very croſs humor, or have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience very much burthened. They firſt of all expatiated on Poems and Romances, and talked much of the Inſtitution of a Poet, and wayes of becoming an Author, and acquiring repute in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is nothing I ſo paſſionately deſire</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hippolita</hi> amongſt the reſt) <hi>as to be able to make a Book, it is the only thing I envy Men for, who make ſo many: I imagine they derive the faculty
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108350:49"/> to do it from the advantage of their Sex. There is no need</hi> (anſwered <hi>Angelica) to deſire to be of another Sex on that account, our own hath in all ages produced ſuch Compoſitons as Men have envied. That is true,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lorenca, but they which write well conceal it as if it were a crime, and they which write ill are the ſcorn and Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talk of the World; ſo that amongſt which ſoever our merit ranges us, there accrues no great glory. For my part,</hi> ſaid <hi>Philalethe</hi> (who was the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Man I ſpoke of) <hi>I am not of this opinion, and hold that they which conceal their knowledge, merit double honour, becauſe they joyn modeſty to ability; neither are the others without ſome praiſe, for their endeavors to raiſe themſelves above their Sex, in deſpite of its weakneſs. And I,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charoſe les, if ever it were in my power, would forbid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll Women coming in print, neither would I ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ffer their Books to be licenced: for the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Poetry and Romances they give us, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt the Stationers money, they have not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to print Grave Authors, that treat of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory and Philoſophy: this hath very ſenſibly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, and extreamly wrongs all Writers of a fertil vain; of which I can ſpeak by experience. Sir, It ſeems to me</hi> (ſaid <hi>Pancrace,</hi> another Gentleman that was there accidentally) <hi>your intereſt obliges to ſpeak, but let us conſider that though many Romances and Poems are printed, many other Voluminous Authors both in Verſe and Proſe are not left out; ſo that the merit of thoſe the Stationers refuſe, may be civilly enough queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. If that were all,</hi> replied <hi>Hippolita, I
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108350:50"/> would not be a jot troubled, for a Stationer that lets me out Romances, would deſire nothing more than to print for me, particularly becauſe I aske no money; for ſcarce any of them ever refuſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies that are freely given: beſides I have ſo many friends and ſo ſtrong a Cabal, I can give them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the ſale. That which you have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned laſt is moſt advantageous for Printing and Selling Books, and my bad fortune is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the want of it alone. At my first coming into the World, I unluckily began to ſatyrize, and ſo incenſed all Authors:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Were I to begin again—You would ſpeak favorably of all,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lorenca</hi> (who had known him long) <hi>and that would be the worſe for you; for that is a thing ſo unuſual, it were a miracle if it took. Well,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charoſelles, I will no more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what is paſſed, ſince it is not to be recalled, but I reſolve to publiſh my Treatiſe of the</hi> Grand Cabal, <hi>which ſhall diſcover the Cheats of many of thoſe admired Authors that carry their heads the higheſt, and prove them to be very Pick-locks of Reputaton; more worthy to be puniſhed than they which carry falſe Dice and cut Purſes, and will find means to get it printed in ſpite of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, though I give it away to ſome of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors taht have brought up a faſhion of Adopting Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is true,</hi> ſaid <hi>Angelica, that Friends and a Cabal have oftentimes ſerved to give Men repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but that laſted no longer than they had the modeſty and diſcretion to conceal their Works; for as ſoon as they have given them to the Publick,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108350:50"/> that hath been impartial, and all reputation that had no ſolid foundations, fell to the ground. I was in a mortal fear</hi> (added <hi>Pancrace) leſt you would have quoted ſome example, that might have engaged us in a quarrel, I mean not one of thoſe in which I know very well how to comport my ſelf with honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> ſaid <hi>Philalethe, will not you reckon in the ſame rank thoſe which make Verſes to be placed at the beginning of Bocks, Prefaces, and Comments; for theſe applaud till they are weary, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending in the leaſt the Authors modeſty. Yes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charoſelles, and it is a very good deſign ſo to beg fame; not but that there may be knavery in it, for an Author will ſometimes borrow a Name of a friend, or ſuppoſe a Romantick one, and under it be very laviſh in his own commendations. Amongſt friends, I may tell you, I have practiſed this with very good ſucceſs, and under a borrowed Name as Commentator to my owne Work, burnt incenſe to my ſelf till I was weary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be this as it may</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hippolita</hi>) I <hi>could never underſtand how it is poſſible to make thoſe huge Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, with concatenation of ſo many intrigues and accidents. I have a hundred times undertaken to make a Romance, but could never bring it about for Songs, Epigrams, and other ſmall pieces; it is ſufficiently known I acquit my ſelf as well as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and that I can make as many as I pleaſe. Take notice,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charoſelles, here is another way to arrive eaſily at reputation in this wretched Age, where we mind nothing but trifles; nothing elſe is valued, nothing elſe ſells, whileſt the ſublimeſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108350:51"/> thoughts and nobleſt conceptions ſtill lie upon our hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It ſeems then,</hi> ſaid <hi>Angelica, you are of that opinion that take Madrigals to be the firſt ſteps to renown, and great Poems the firſt towards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. 'Tis poſſible,</hi> added <hi>Pancrace, but how can ſuch trifles give any honour? You mention not their main advantage</hi> (added <hi>Lorenca) which is to be ſe to Tunes. That certainly is the reaſon</hi> (cried <hi>Charoſelles) that all theſe ſmall Poets court the beſt Muſicians, who never make Airs to any Verſes but thoſe of their Favorites; for if they ſhould they would have a great deal of work. It cannot be denied, ſaid</hi> Philalethes, <hi>but this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very good, for by this means their Verſes are ſung by the greateſt Beauties of the Court; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they are famous thorow the World: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the goodneſs of the Tune, like Paint, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and dazles; and I have heard many things commended when ſung, that written had neither rime nor reaſon. I compare them,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to thoſe ill ſhaped Images, which covered over with Glaſs, paſs for admirable in a Cloſet. And I,</hi> ſaid Pancrace, <hi>to a Droget Suit, which the humor of ſome great Perſon hath enriched with Embroidery. This puts me in mind,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lorenca, of a man I have ſeen at the Court of a great Princeſs, that get a high reputation by that harmonious trifle: he had worded many Songs, and pretended to have very ſublime fancies, and indeed they were above all underſtanding; but without this never produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced two lines that were not hiſt at. I admire at it</hi> (ſaid <hi>Hippolita) for Court Poets, have ever their Trains of Applauders.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:108350:51"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Either his Book was very bad or he had few friends. That was it I looked for</hi> (ſaid <hi>Charoſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les) and I hold that there is nothing more neceſſary to the reputation of a Poet, than either to frequent the Court or to have been bred there; for a Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit is little conſiderable. I would have him have acceſs to all Alcoves, Aſſemblies and Academies of Gallantry, with a</hi> Mecenas <hi>of eminent quality to protect him, and make his Works conſiderable, and that in ſo high a manner that men ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to commend them whether they would or no, and not to make their Court without doing it. I would have him write to the greateſt Lords for the Maids of Honour, and on all</hi> Adventures <hi>of the</hi> Cabinet; <hi>counterfeit himſelf to be in love, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome borrowed Name, or in a Romance: but the higheſt of his fortune were to write a Maske, Play, or Epick Poem, above which</hi> Poets <hi>have nothing to aſpire to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>cannot deny,</hi> ſaid <hi>Angelica, but all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, eſpecially the countenance and authority of a great Perſon are very advantageous; for three Quarters of the World judge of Books with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever looking on them, and are of the opinion of him that firſt cenſures them, as</hi> Sheep <hi>ſtill follow their</hi> Leader. <hi>You many adde,</hi> ſaid <hi>Phila-lethes, that many talk ſo long contrary to their judgement, that they loſe it, and at laſt approve of that they with very great reaſon at firſt condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; becauſe they have been ſo many times obliged to ſpeak favorably of it, out of other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> I <hi>my ſelf</hi> (ſaid <hi>Pancrace) knew once a</hi> Court Poet <hi>very much eſteemed; becauſe Men ſometimes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108350:52"/> made their fortunes by commending his Verſes, as by bad Verſes had before made his own. I know him alſo,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hippolita, and find he was not eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without reaſon, for amongſt all</hi> Poets <hi>ſuch as enjoy</hi> Wealth <hi>and</hi> Honour <hi>have my</hi> Vote, <hi>and for thoſe that have ſo much, they can keep</hi> Coaches, <hi>I think it inſolence to cenſure their</hi> Works. <hi>To be born</hi> rich, <hi>will as ſoon raiſe a</hi> Poet <hi>to</hi> renown, <hi>as the</hi> Natural Genius <hi>ſo much talked of, and which hath cauſed it to be ſaid</hi> Orators <hi>may be bred, but</hi> Poets <hi>muſt be born. And for my part I would adviſe any that had a mind to be of this</hi> Trade, <hi>to ſell all to purchaſe one of theſe</hi> Chariots of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: <hi>To ſay truth,</hi> Poets <hi>or</hi> Muſicians Coaches (<hi>for both theſe we daily behold) cost no much; nay I know a</hi> Lords, <hi>whoſe</hi> Furniture <hi>coſt but Four Pounds, and had the misfortune to be mired in the blowings of ſome body's Noſe; neither is the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it any great matter, ſuch Gallants uſually living no other Mens charges, whether in</hi> Town <hi>or</hi> Countrey, <hi>ſometimes with one, ſometimes with another. Alas,</hi> interrupted <hi>Charoſelles, this</hi> Diſcourſe <hi>is to no purpoſe; I long kept a</hi> Coach <hi>to this very end, likely enough (as you know) to paſs for an</hi> Authors Coach, <hi>yet my</hi> Credit <hi>is loſt amongſt theſe</hi> damned Stationers, <hi>that will print no more of my</hi> Works.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I can give you good counſel,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lorenca, and that is to deliver looſe</hi> Pieces <hi>to ſuch as make</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, <hi>who ſuffer nothing to eſcape them. The good give value to the bad, as</hi> falſe Money <hi>paſſes when mixed amongſt that which is current. This invention I thought of,</hi> anſwered <hi>Charoſelles,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108350:52"/> with a great ſigh, but it would ſerve but one time, for after they had refuſed a whole</hi> Book <hi>of mine, having baſhed it ſmall, and preſented it in</hi> Epiſodes <hi>and</hi> Fragments, <hi>I indeed got the Volume, though all my own, to be printed, under the Title of</hi> A Collection of Pieces of ſeveral Authors; <hi>yet the</hi> Stationer <hi>at laſt unluckily diſcovered the trick, and reproached me with its lying on his hands. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at that,</hi> anſwered <hi>Philalethes, for</hi> Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>have formerly ſold well. It is true, they are a little decryed of late, in that particular like</hi> Wine <hi>good for nothing when it runs low, though excellent, when firſt ſet a-broach. But</hi> (ſaid Hippolita) <hi>do you not find that theſe</hi> Collections <hi>make us</hi> famous <hi>very eaſily and at ſmall charge? Many</hi> Authors <hi>are no otherwiſe known.</hi> I <hi>have a good mind to do the like, and can find</hi> Odes <hi>and</hi> Elegies <hi>enough to print in my Name, which if it be neceſſary,</hi> I <hi>will prefix to them.</hi> I <hi>think,</hi> ſaid <hi>Angelica, this may ſerve at leaſt for an</hi> Eſſay <hi>to-wards</hi> reputation; <hi>for if the</hi> Pieces <hi>we adventure upon take, the glory is our own ſecurely; if they fail we are quit for diſ-avowing them, or ſaying,</hi> They were taken from us by ſtealth, and never made by us with intention to publiſh.</p>
               <p>I <hi>acknowledge,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pancrace, that ſuch as have</hi> reputation, <hi>and whoſe</hi> Works <hi>have gained the</hi> approbation <hi>of</hi> Cabinets <hi>and</hi> Alcoves, <hi>have preſerved this in</hi> Collections; <hi>but</hi> I <hi>find not that ſuch as were formerly</hi> obſcure <hi>have had any great</hi> ſucceſs <hi>by them; for which reaſon very few Qualified Perſons have ſet their Names to them.</hi> I <hi>was the other day,</hi> ſaid Philalethes,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108350:53"/> 
                  <hi>Spectator of a difference that will very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what you ſay, and this was in the</hi> Shop <hi>of one of the greateſt</hi> Printers <hi>of</hi> Collections; <hi>A</hi> well qualified Perſon, <hi>that would not paſs for a declared Author, threatned to beat him for having printed ſome</hi> Verſes <hi>of</hi> Gallantry <hi>in his</hi> Name, <hi>and placing it in the Catalogue of</hi> Authors <hi>at the beginning of the</hi> Book, <hi>which he had poſted at the</hi> Corners <hi>of</hi> Streets. <hi>The</hi> Stationer <hi>in a lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tone, nay really weeping, ſaid,</hi> Alas, Sir, the condition of us poor Stationers is very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and we are ſtrangeiy put to it, to give content to Authors; but juſt now went one from hence, that threatned me no leſs than you have done, becauſe I put not his Name to a Song, and ſaying this, he ſhewed him the Song, which was the worſt piece in the Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>See the difference of</hi> humors, ſaid Lorenca, <hi>it had been very pleaſant if theſe two Gallants had put their deſigns in execution at one and the ſame time. For my part,</hi> ſaid Charoſelles, <hi>I cannot condemn thoſe that ſeek</hi> glory <hi>this way, for in</hi> Poetry (<hi>which you know I have alwayes conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a trifle) I have obſerved the worſt Traffick is to deal in groſs, I mean to print ones Works all together, and make a Volume; it is a better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to vent them by parcels, and give them out piece by piece, as Men uſe to do by Rattles and Windwills to pleaſe Children. Your Maxime is ſufficiently confirmed by experience,</hi> ſaid Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica, <hi>for we have know</hi> Authors <hi>whoſe ſmall</hi> Pieces <hi>have acquired as much or more glory than</hi> Volumes <hi>publiſhed at once by others, and that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108350:53"/> effectually, were of greater merit. Wonder not at that,</hi> ſaid <hi>Philalethes, the impatient humor of our Nation is tired with long Works; and this is remarkable, in that ſuch as have in their hands</hi> Book <hi>of</hi> Poetry, <hi>will ſooner read a Sonnet than an Elegy, and an Epigram than a Sonnet: and if a Book contain onely Epigrams, thoſe of four or ſix Verſes ſhall be read ſooner than toſe of a dozen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am very glad, ſaid</hi> Hippolita, <hi>that ſmall Pieces are better eſteemed in</hi> France <hi>than great ones, for for Madrigals I can make themas I liſt, as I ſaid before; for there belongs no more to it, but to find out a ſmooth line or two and there is an end: whereas it is hard to come by conceits for Epigrams and Verſes of State for Sonnets. But,</hi> ſaid <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſelles, all this is not enough to make ſmall pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to take they muſt ſuit the times, I mean the Mode, and for quicker diſpatch in the ſale, the Subject muſt be choice, as on the death of my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies little Dog, her Parret, or ſome other great Adventure happend in the gallant and poetical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For my part,</hi> replied <hi>Hippolita, above all other I love Diſtichs, becauſe they are commonly</hi> ex tempore, <hi>which I judge to be the moſt certain token of wit. You are not alone in your opinion,</hi> ſaid <hi>Angelica, I have know many Women ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted on theſe</hi> ex tempories, <hi>they have preferred them to the perfecteſt Works and moſt ſtudious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. I am not of the opinion of thoſe Ladies (Charoſelles</hi> briskly replied) <hi>and I know no certainer ſign of reprobation in what relates to Poetry, than to be taken with ſuch things, for they which are
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108350:54"/> beſt at them, are only gay and ſportive perſons, nay ſometimes ſuch as are mad are happy enough in them; whereas a true eſteem belongs only to Pieces wrought with mature deliberations, where Art and Nature unite. Not but that the greatest Wits may ſometimes produce Gallantries on the ſudden, but it must be done very diſcreetly, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they expoſe themſelves to ſtrange abſurdities, as almoſt all ſudden Wits ſometimes do. Adde to this,</hi> ſaid <hi>Philalethes, that no ware is vended that is more deceitful; for as at Gaming Ordinaries men often cheat with falſe Dice, no leſs is done in</hi> Academies <hi>with</hi> Extempories, <hi>and ſome take thoſe to have newly ſeen the light that indeed are old and weather beaten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is true,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pancrace, and I have known a certain pleaſant fellow, well enough look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon in the World, that never went without</hi> Pocket Ex tempories, <hi>and had provided ſo many on ſeveral Subjects, that he had large</hi> Common Places. <hi>He uſually carried along with him ſome one, with whom he correſponded, by whoſe aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he diverted the diſcourſe to ſeveral Subjects, and ſo drew people into ſtraits, where he had laid ſome</hi> Ex temporie <hi>ambuſh, and then the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant fell on and defeated the braveſt Champions of Wit, not without the admiration of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am glad,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lorenca, to be informed of the deceits that are committed, becauſe in any ſuch things be hereafter preſented me, I ſhall deſire at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of honeſt and honourable Perſons, that they were made in their preſence without fraud or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108350:54"/> covin. I</hi> (ſaid <hi>Angelica) never applauded ſuch Pieces, for this were to ſell reputation at a very low rate, which I reſerve for polite and ſerious Works, particularly for Sonnets; which are (as one of my good friends calls them) the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces of Poetry, and the moſt Noble of all Poems.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You will not often be in a condition to be laviſh of of them</hi> (added <hi>Charoſelles) for it requires a great ſtock of wit to be ſucceſsful in them; neither do many profeſs the making them, and even they for one good one give us a hundred that are bad. I have ſeen ſo many bad ones,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pancrace, I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the greateſt part of them are ſuch, and unleſs ſome underſtanding perſon aſſure me of their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I cannot find in my heart to read them. I have</hi> (ſaid <hi>Philalethes) been long ſenſible of the difficulty to make good ones, and ſeen eminent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets that have acquired glory by great Poems, whoſe reputations have fallen in ſome Sonnet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now you ſpeak of Sonnets</hi> (ſaid <hi>Javota,</hi> who had till then been ſilent) <hi>I have a very good one about me, which a Client of my Fathers left in his Study. Pancrace</hi> beſought her to oblige them with the reading it, and adding grace to it. <hi>I beg of you to excuſe me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Javota, for it is ſo long ſo long, ſo long, it would give you too great interruption. How,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hippolita, is ſo much time neceſſary to the reading 14 lines?</hi> In the mean while <hi>Javota</hi> took out of her Pocket a little Book ſtitched in Marble Paper, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an entire Poem; it was called, <hi>The Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morophoſis of the Eyes of</hi> Phillis <hi>into Stars.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:108350:55"/>
               <p>The Company could not forbear laughing at this ſimplicity, <hi>Hippolita</hi> burſt out; at which, <hi>Javota</hi> bluſhing, ſaid, <hi>How are not theſe Verſes? I am ſure my fatehr told me they were. Yes queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs,</hi> anſwered <hi>Pancrace. Well,</hi> ſaid <hi>Javota, and are not Sonnets Verſes, why all this laughing?</hi> The laughing increaſed, till <hi>Angelica</hi> in civility broke it off, and went to <hi>Javota</hi> to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and help her out of her confuſion; which ſhe effected by many reiterated careſſes. <hi>Pancrace</hi> alſo joyned with her, and employed himſelf very heartily: he had already entered into a particular conerſation with <hi>Javota,</hi> to whom from the firſt he had an extraordinary inclination. But they were now interrupted by a great Cry of <hi>Hippolita, What have we here?</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I muſt needs ſee what it contains:</hi> and this ſhe ſpoke on occaſion of a Roll of Paper fallen out of <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Pocket as ſhe aroſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly. <hi>Angelica</hi> very civilly deſired her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it, reproaching her for prying into her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. <hi>Secrets,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hippolita, uſe not to be ſo voluminous, it is certainly ſome piece of Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the pleaſure of which you muſt not engroſſe to your ſelf. At leaſt let me ſee the Title,</hi> which as ſoon as ſhe had read, ſhe cried out yet lowder, <hi>You were the moſt diſobliging perſon in the world, would you deprive ſo good company of the diverſion of a Piece, whoſe Title promiſes ſo fairly. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ſhall not deny me to take it home and read it: Do your worſt, I claim my ſhare,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles, and my opinion is that it be read here, and in requital I will read you another compoſition of my

                  <q>LIttle <hi>Cupid</hi> was ever an incorrigible Brat, cockered and humored by his too indulgent Mother. The whole Celeſtial Court complained of him, <hi>Juno,</hi> that he ſuffered her not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy her Husband two dayes together; <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> that he debauched all her Nymphs, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> indeed was unattempted by him, for ſhe underſtood not raillery; <hi>Venus</hi> often threatned to whip him, but did it not, though to make good her menaces, ſhe ſteeped twigs of Mirtle in Vinegar, which did nor a little terrife him. But when ſhe went about to correct him, he ſtill ſheltered himſelf by favor of the Graces, who would gladly have hidden him under their Coats, had they not been naked. But one day, when ſhe was in a croſs humor (I know not whether upon the News of the Death of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108350:56"/> 
                     <hi>Adonis</hi>) ſhe reſolved to pay him in good earneſt; and her Graces having forſaken her by reaſon of her Melancholy, be found not his womed Sanctuary. He had been then in a bad condition, without the uſual recourſe of Children, who run from their Mothers to their Grand-mothers: he therefore caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf headlong into the arms of <hi>Thetis,</hi> that was not far off, and loſt no time in ſtripping, becauſe he goes alwayes naked; his Wings ſerving him inſtead of Oars, he ſoon arrived at her Cryſtal Pallace; where ſeeing him weep, ſhe began to cokes him, and (as thoſe good old Women are wont to do, that applaud all the fopperies of their Grand-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) gave him Sugar Plums. He liked his entertainment ſo well, that he tarried long, but unable to give over his old wonts, ſo inflamed the Fiſhes (till that time naturally cold) with the Fire of Love, that they ſoon became the moſt Prolifick Animals, in ſuch a manner, that <hi>Thetis</hi> Kingdom is now ſo populous, that did not her Subject (like Wolves and Poets) devour one another, though the Plains of the Ocean are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly vaſt, ſhe could neither feed nor quarter them. Had he done no more, the miſchief had not yet been great; though we reckon in his enflaming the Sirens, who are the Singing Women of that Court, Perſons of that Profeſſion being uſually Libertines; but he attacqued the <hi>Nereides</hi> themſelves, who are the Princeſſes and Ladies of Honour

She condemned the <hi>Nereid</hi> to be ſhut up during life in a Priſon of Ice at the bottom of the <hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> and the Seducer in the Shell of a Snail, where he ſince abſconds, never daring to ſhew his horns, unleſs at the end of a Storm; for the little Incendiary that had cauſed the diſorder, <hi>Thetis</hi> reſolved immediately to puniſh him, and cauſed a handful of Coral Branches to be gathered to whip him ſoundly; for Coral whileſt in the <hi>Sea</hi> is ſupple as Ozier, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hard nor red till it comes into the air: this is averred by <hi>Pliny,</hi> whom, if you be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you will not refuſe to own as a creditable Author. <hi>Cupid</hi> was then in as great danger as ever, and ſaw many Crabs who are the Catch-poles of that Countrey, ready to ſeiſe him; but he ſlipt from them like an Eel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamly active and nimble (eſpecially at evaſions) and got to the Shore out of the power of his rigorous Grand-mother. He was yet in a Countrey where he was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, if he would have diſcovered himſelf, for it belonged to <hi>Cibele</hi> the Mother of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108350:58"/> Deities, his Great great Grand-Mother, but ſhe being old, wrinckled, and crooked, and her head dreſſed with Towns and Caſtles, the ſight of her frighted him; beſides fear of the Rod which he had eſcaped, being the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Puniſhment of Children, gave him a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct of all his Relations; he reſolved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conceal himſelf, in order to which he thought beſt to retire to the Cottages of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Shepherds he ſaw thereabouts: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him well and charitably gave him a Suit of Clothes, which becauſe he was naked they thought he ſtood in need of, for they underſtood not the heat of his Conſtitution. I know not whether apprehenſion of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had made him wiſer, or whither he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerated the ignorance of his Hoſts, but he comported himſelf amongſt them very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, without either malice or circumvenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and, in recompence of their charitable entertainment, taught them the Art of Love: for if you have not already learned it, be pleaſed that I tell you that till this time Love was not known to men, who made all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes like Beaſts only by natural inſtinct, and in order to generation. This Noble Paſſion that inſinuates into hearts, gives them ſo high ſatisfactions, and unites ſouls ſooner than bodies, was yet a ſtranger in the world, the Deitres having reſerved it to themſelves as a more delicate morſel.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108350:58"/> ſtrange that they have recorded them with ſo much Eloquence, having had ſuch a School-Maſter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>As all things are perfecter and leſs corrupt, whileſt nearer their Originals, ſo the firſt Loves were with all purity and vertue imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. That Deity ſo well ordered his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, that the Flames were ever mutual in the hearts of Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes, deſires of pleaſing only poſſeſſed them, their affections were reciprocal and fidelities invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable; there were no Complaints of Cruelty or Rigor, becauſe no unjuſt deſires, neither any regret or ſorrow, becauſe Vice had no ſhare. In a word this was Loves Golden Age.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>But having paſſed ſome time here he grew weary of ſolitude, and curious of knowing what paſſed in the World, which his youth had not till then permitted him to viſit, and therefore reſolved to go to a Neighbouring Town, where becauſe it was great and fair, he reſided, till acquainted with it. The firſt thing he did was to ſee a ſervice, and wonder not that this Divinity deſended ſo low, for ſlavery is his Element. Chance firſt of all engaged him with a Woman not unhandſome, but whoſe Phyſiognomy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed much ſimplicity: her Hair was flaxen and her Complexion fair but faint, her Eyes grey but dull, her Stature tall but heavy; and if theſe things may be tolerated, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe handſom and agreeable: her Name was
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108350:59"/> 
                     <hi>Laudora,</hi> and ſhe had a general indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for all the World; ſhe expreſſed a certain contempt, which yet was not the effect of Pride, but of a flegmatick temper that made men deſpair. In a word, ſhe was ſo neglective of all, that it was very apparent ſhe took nothing to heart. <hi>Cupid</hi> had not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved long with her before he attempted the ſame thing he had done amongſt the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, being unwilling to diſcontinue his Archery, the only quality that makes him conſiderable; he made ſeveral ſhot with a little Pocker Bow, but at firſt rather for ſport than out of deſign, as Children uſe to play with Trunks. One day taking from the ground one of the Arrows he had ſhot at <hi>Laudore,</hi> he perceived the point turned; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vexes this little Rebel like reſiſtance, which cauſed him obſtinately to reſolve to be revenged on this inſenſibility: he took there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome of his ſharpeſt Arrows, and, whileſt ſhe was in good company, ſhot ſeveral right at her heart: but it was miraculous to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that they had no other effect againſt this heart of Diamond, than Balls againſt the Walls of a Tennis-Court; yet in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundings wounded thoſe that were near. Theſe uſed all imaginable endeavors, that ſhe which was the cauſe of their miſchief might ſhare in it; but nothing had ſucceſs: all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and all Gallantries were expelled by her rigor. But at laſt there came into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a certain Man neither handſom not ill-favored;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108350:59"/> his face promiſed much honeſty, and no leſs ſtupidity; he was tall and ſlender, but weak and ſtooping; his gate unequal, his mouth wide, his hair long and uncurled like hemp.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Behind this Gallant <hi>Cupid</hi> one day poſted himſelf to attaque his Rebel, he had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to do a favour to one he had but little kindneſs for, it was rather to put a trick on him, and make him ſerve as an object of the ſhaft that glanced from <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>At that very inſtant the indifference of the Lady vaniſhed, and ſhe had an inexpreſſible inclination for this Man; to ſuch a degree that ſhe was ready to diſcover her paſſion, had not her Sexes modeſty reſtrained her: but at laſt ſhe found an opportunity to give vent to the ſecret without much difficulty, becauſe they were daily together; he almoſt at the ſame time had the like inclinations for her; perhaps one of the ineffectual Arrows of which we ſpoke before, fell on his great toe, and its venom inſenſibly reached the heart: in a word, they loved, but with ſo ſlack a fire, there was no appearance of it either by ſighs or complaints, yet never were any hearts more firmly united. All the addreſſes which in other encounters pretend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire love, were here inſignificant, they though it enough to court by glances, and ſcarce ever made uſe of words; and the moſt ſerious employment of this ſilly Amour was to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108350:60"/> tred on one anothers toe, or look on one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other without laughing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Cupid</hi> liked not this manner of proceeding, nor that they were ſo indifferent in an affair that ſo many perſon of quality take to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry important; his inclination tending to be ſerviceable to all he wounds, he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to be uſeleſs of theſe Lovers, and his airy Complexion ſuffered him not to be long idle, he therefore reflected on the wound he had made, for (to give him but his due) he can play the Philoſopher when he pleaſes, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues well, eſpecially when his Eyes are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieled: he then perceived he was miſtaken, in attributing to himſelf the honour of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, and acknowledged it belonged to chance alone, that had given a meeting to two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe faces and humors had ſo much of reſemblance and ſympathy, they ſeemed born for each other; and from this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that for the future many Crimes might be imputed to him of which he ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Shame of effecting nothing at laſt cauſed him to ſeek his diſcharge; which was not hard to be obtained of Maſters that could ſo eaſily ſpare him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this he engaged himſelf in ſervice of a Lady much given to reading, with her be at firſt very much pleaſed himſelf, becauſe he hoped to learn many ſecrets, and not to want employment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Lady, whoſe Name was <hi>Polymathia,</hi> had not inherited ſo much Beauty, but her
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108350:60"/> Deformity exceeded it, and I am unwilling to give a full deſcription of her, leſt I diſtaſte ſuch Readers as are of a queaſie ſtomack: neitehr is it poſſible for any Lady to pretend both to Beauty and Science, for much read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing takes from the luſtre of their Eyes, and the delicacy of their Complexion decayes, if they paſs not their time idlely and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: beſides that it is very hard for them to ſpare any hour of the day for Study, which is all of it ſcarcely ſufficient to dreſs and paint themſelves. But <hi>Polymathia</hi>'s wit was incomparable, and ſhe ſpoke ſo well that ſhe muſt needs have charmed all Ears had ſhe not affrighted all Eyes. She was skilled in Philoſophy and the ſublimeſt Arts, and theſe ſhe had accommodated to the guſt of Perſons of Quality, retaining nothing that ſavors of the Pedantry of the Schools. Her admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Compoſitions both in Verſe an Proſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to her the moſt eminent and elegant of her time: <hi>Love</hi> would not here let his Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be uſeleſs, yet forbore a while, becauſe his Miſtriſſes excellent Conceptions of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Temperance, made him deſpair of ſucceſs, orconquering that rigor ſhe ſo much gloried in: he had alſo ſome reſpect for the Philoſophy that ſeconded her, not without reaſon apprehending to be ſeverely handled by it: he alſo made ſome conſcience of the ill office he ſhold do her by inſpiring her with love not being confident of his power to raiſe a paſſion for her in any heart, unleſs he
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108350:61"/> ſought it amongſt the blind: he reſolved therefore firſt of all to try what he could do with ſome of the <hi>Virtuoſo</hi>'s that frequented her, but it was to no purpoſe, his Arrows falling with as little effect as if ſhot againſt Wooll-ſacks; but that which moſt enraged him, was the diſſimulation of thoſe Rabbies (for there is not any Deity, how fabulous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but is infinitely offended by hypocriſie) who thought it not enough to admire her wit, but would alſo ſeem taken with her beauty, and their impudence went ſo high to qualifie her with <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Aurore</hi> in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Verſes they ſent her. They which had only ſeen her in this falſe Mirror, and flattering Draught, would never have known her: for to ſpeak truth, all her reſemblance of the Sun was the Yellow Jaundies, and of the Moon the inequality of her Cheeks, with as little of <hi>Aurora</hi> excepting the Carnation of her Noſe. Alas how are poor Readers abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Poets that pretend to ſincerity, if they take their Verſes literally. They form beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Idea's of Chimerical Perſons, that have no reſemblance of the Originals. And when we find,

                  <q>In this ſhe will never gainſay any one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by a falſe modeſty.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108350:62"/> but ill with the other, all its luſtre conſiſting in a Scarlet Border certainly in grain, ſince the water that inceſſantly diſtilled upon it, could not decay it: But if his Body gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte his wit charmed. He would have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded admirably in Spaniſh Courtſhip, which is practiſed onely by night, for darkneſs would have been very favorable to him. The heart of this hard-favored wit was no ſooner wounded, but Elegies, Sonnets, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigals flew about without number; never was there a fertiler vein, or more inflamed Genius: never ſo great profuſion of tender paſſions in rhime: but that which is more than uſuul, is, that then all diſſimulation vaniſhed, all the Charms and Graces he at firſt put in his Verſes onely as Poetical Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he afterwards inſerted in good earneſt, and believed in his conſcience that his Miſtriſs was a true Sun and a true <hi>Aurora:</hi> and though her wit alone gave the firſt fire to this love, the tender <hi>Hero</hi> was ſo dazled with its luſtre, he could no longer diſcern any imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in her body, having no leſs paſſion for it. I cannot tell whether Love made two wounds with one Arrow, or whether <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathia</hi> were touched with the Poetical Points of her Lover; but ſhe loved reciprocally, and did wiſely not to let an occaſion ſlip, ſhe could ſcarcely ever have hoped to recover. She was no more niggard than he, either of Verſe or Proſe, and diſguiſed <hi>Cupid</hi> then wanted not employment, nor occaſions to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108350:62"/> exerciſe his Legs. He had no ſooner carried a Letter, but he was ſent again with Verſes; and if he unfortunately obtained an <hi>ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> Anſwer, a Reply was diſpatched with no leſs diligence: and in this skirmiſh of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation our Lovers were as nimble with their <hi>Ex tempore</hi>'s as the beſt Gameſters with their Tennis-balls. I will neither relate the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance nor concluſion of their Loves, that laſted long with equal violence, but all the profit accrued to ſuch Stationers as print Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of amorous and tender Pieces, who made many Volumes. Other Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men got nothing by them, no Jewels nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Curioſities, all Preſents were made in Paper. He neither gave her Ball nor Muſick, but an infinite number of Verſes for Balls, and of Rimes to be ſet to Tunes: but that which is moſt admirable and contrary to the humor of the times, there was neither Treat nor Collation; they took the Air pure and ſimple, without making any Inne-keepers the better either in their Credit or Eſtate. <hi>Cupid</hi> had been hitherto fed with ſlender and courſe Diet, but I ſhall tell you how he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came lickoriſh. One day, whileſt his ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored Miſtriſs ſought ſolitude in a little Grove, where ſhe entruſted many ſighs and tranſports to the diſcretion of the Air and Eccho; he keeping at a diſtance, accidentally lighted on the Page of a great Lady, at that time treated in a Pleaſure-Houſe near the Wood: no acquaintance being ſooner made
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108350:63"/> than that of Dogs and Lackeys (in which I comprehended all that wear Liveries) Love and the Page were quickly familiar: his new Comrade carried him to ſee the great Feaſt provided for his Lady, and both of them ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied themſelves with what was left. <hi>Cupid</hi> was well pleaſed with Bisks and Pheaſants, which put him in mind of <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſia;</hi> but that which he liked beſt, was a Diſh of Early Peaſe, that coſt more money than an Acre of the ground they had been ſown in. His good cheer and confidence in what his Comrade told him, debauched him, and he made no difficulty of entring himſelf in the ſervice of that Lady, who as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, entertained him to carry up her Train. Thus he left his <hi>Virtuoſa</hi> Miſtriſs, without ever bidding her adieu; ſhe was much troubled that no body had been bound for his truth, that ſhe might have made them pay the value of certain Verſes the little Thief carried away, of which ſhe had no Copy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>His new Miſtriſs carreſſed him, endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by all inventions imaginable to make him fine; ſhe gave him certain Trowſes, with which the modeſter Painters, that are loth to draw him naked, ſtill apparel him. How dangerous ſoever he was eſteemed before, all was nothing compared to the miſchief he did when clothed. <hi>Archilaide,</hi> that was his Ladies Name, was perfectly accompliſhed; for beſides an eminent Beauty, her Birth gave her a certain Majeſtick Air, much to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108350:63"/> her advantage over thoſe whoſe well-ſhaped Bodies might otherwiſe have equalled her: Incence and Adoration were lawful Tributes paid freely to her Merit. Love that had been bred in a place where ſuch Preſents were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually received, almoſt thought he was got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into his own Countrey, and extreamly pleaſed himſelf in this Court, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and in diſguiſe. He obſerved what profound reſpect many Illuſtrious Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges paid to that viſible Divinity he diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to ſerve. But after his continuance a while, one thing diſpleaſed him, on account of his pretence that in all places of his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, there ought to be ſomething of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and agreeable correſpondence; for here was nothing of it, they that waited on <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaide,</hi> not daring to raiſe their eyes to her, no not in admiration of her; and her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſdain deprived them of all the confidence their merit might juſtly have allowed them: this was the greateſt occaſion that moved Love to attempt a Rock, whoſe Pride ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Skies; for his Honour invites him to Illuſtrious Conqueſts, and to taming the moſt rebellious hearts. In the mean time, like an experienced Captain, before he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Battery, he went himſelf to view the ground; his divinity gave him great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for doing this, for by its Prerogative he dives to the bottom of hearts, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the greateſt ſecrets: viſiting that of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaide,</hi> he was not a little ſurpriſed to ſee
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108350:64"/> that Nature had already effected what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and ſo well diſpoſed all materials, that the leaſt ſpark of his Torch muſt needs raiſe a Conflagration able to reduce all to aſhes. He was deſirous immediately to redreſs the miſchief he had done, but found no remedy more ready than to diſcharge new Arrows on thoſe that approached her, that they might flock to aſſiſt her, by extinguiſhing her flames. All Perſons of quality, wit, or good meen immediately offered their ſervice, but ſtill with reſpects and ſubmiſſions ſcarce ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. What courage ſoever Love inſpired into the hearts he maſtered, none amongſt them durſt declare his love, nor uſe the leaſt tender expreſſion: they were Mutes, that durſt hardly ſuffer their eyes to ſpeak for them, and that in ſuch a manner ſtifled their fighs they were imperceptible to the quickeſt ear: they were prepoſſeſſed by a Maxime damned as heretical in Loves School, <hi>That we are to wait in expectation of thoſe favors from Ladies of Quality, that we may demand of others.</hi> But the Wretches languiſhed long in theſe hopes; <hi>Archelaide</hi> was ſo jealous of her honour, and naturally ſo proud, ſhe would have died a thouſand times rather than complained in the leaſt: She thought it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous to caſt her eyes on any that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her, with whom this would in ſome manner have equalized her, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to a loſs of reſpect; ſhe therefore placed a ſurly Porter at her Gate, to keep our
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108350:64"/> all Plunderers of that Vertue and Honour ſhe entruſted to him; but the misfortune was, there was no body to keep out the Porter, whom ſhe ſometimes called to her aſſiſtance in preſſing neceſsities, to drive away the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret diſcontents occaſioned by ſolitude. The Houſhold Spie, to whom nothing that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to honour is concealed, one day diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the intrigue of this Adventure, and made himſelf know to her with all thoſe Beauties that raiſed the Curioſity of <hi>Pſyche.</hi> He bitterly reproached her of the wrong ſhe did all the Empire of Love, by diſtruſting ſo many Perſons of Quality, as languiſhed for her, and committing her honour to the diſcretion of a Clowniſh Servant: He made her ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhe deſerved not to enjoy the ſweets that are to be found in this Nobl Paſsion, and at laſt threatned to be revenged by leaving her, and publiſhing her Story: He ſwore alſo by his Torch, that ſince Honour had put this trick upon him, he would be revenged; that he would ever after be his profeſſed Enemy, and force him from all places where he ſhould chance to meet him. <hi>Archelaide</hi> that took this Apparition for a Dream, rubbed her Eyes as if ſhe had ſlept, and inſtead of the Deity ſhe thought to have ſeen, finding only her Page, picked a quarrel with him, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Maſter of her Horſe to whip him: but Love and the Page ſuddenly vaniſhed, and ſhe finding the menace of abandoning her made good, doubted no more of her Viſion.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108350:65"/> She made ſuch uſe of this that ſhe forſook the World, and retired to a ſolitude far from Palaces and Porters, where ſhe hath ſince lived very modeſtly and reſerved.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Though Love was troubled at this affront, he would not ſo ſoon forſake the Earth, where he thought he might learn ſomething. He got into the ſervice of a Woman called <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phile,</hi> of indifferent Wit and Beauty; at this firſt coming, that he might gain her good will, he acquired her many Servants with his uſual arms; this extreamly pleaſed her, for though ſhe paſſed amongſt her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for very diſcreet, ſhe heard not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commiſeration the ſighs of thoſe that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for her: in ſhort, ſhe was of thoſe that may be called gallant Platonicks, a race that hath lately extreamly multipilied. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffered ſo much as under this laſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs, though ſhe clothed him at firſt very handſomely, in a Livery well laced and trimmed with Ribbands of three Colours, and gave him as a Sirname <hi>Grideline.</hi> Her greateſt delight was to wear rich Cloths, in which her Curioſity extended to Exceſs. She was never ſenſible of the dullneſs of her wit, unleſs when it came ſhort in the invention of new Faſhions; this admirably ſet off her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Beauty, but her moſt powerful Charms were an extraordinary Civility and Complacency for new Comers, and the like to retain thoſe ſhe doubted might forſake her. On the other ſide ſhe ſeemed very ſevere, to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:108350:65"/> ſuch as ſhe thought ſhe had engaged ſo faſt, there was no danger of their eſcaping her fetters. There never was any Woman ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of hearts; all Colours and all Shapes pleaſed her, the faire, the brown, the witty, the dull, the Courtier, the Citizen, were all welcome, neither did ſhe care of whom, ſo ſhe made a Conqueſt. Her greateſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was to breave a Miſtriſs of her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and her higheſt diſpleaſure to loſe the leaſt of her own; yet ſhe made great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in her treating her Cajolers: for ſhe it was that firſt made the diſtinction between Courtiers and Countrey Gentlemen, and gave precedence to Lace and Feathers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>She had a particular eſteem for rich trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings and heads newly powdered, ſhe would yet receive well the plaineſt that lent her Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances and new Poems: the rich Clown that gave her Muſick and carried her to Plays, was ſtill wellcome: and in order to more Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers, certain dayes of the week were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined to receive Gallants in her Alcove, as there are for Markets in Publick Places. Her new ſervant, as hath been ſaid, got her many Victories, and never had more frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to uſe his Bow, it is no wonder he aims now ſo right at a heart, having practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſo frequently.</q>

                  <q>All the wounded had recourſe to <hi>Poliphile</hi> for remedy, whoſe Careſſes gave them hopes of Cure, but ſhe dealt with them like dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Surgeons, who dreſsing a ſmall wound,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108350:66"/> with Cauſticks and Inciſions, make it great and dangerous: ſo ſhe with Flatteries caſt Oil and their Fire, and impoiſoned that ſhe pretended to heal. Neither did Love neglect to revenge them, by ſhooting many Arrows at the heart of <hi>Poliphile,</hi> but he was amazed to ſee that the moſt of them only raced the skin, and if they at any time made deeper wounds, they were cloſed by next day, as if the Powder of Sympathy had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to them: But it was worſe, when he found out that <hi>Poliphile,</hi> not ſatisfied with the Beauties impareted to her by Heaven, borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others: he was then a Stranger to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe and Artifice, knowing neither Paint, Pomade, Black Patches, nor falſe Looks; ſo that having at night ſeen his Miſtriſs go to Bed with Black Hair, he knew her not next day when ſhe more Flaxen: and ſeeing her face covered with Black Patches, thought they ſerved to hide Pimples or Sratches. But Love had not long continued in this School, before he got experience, and became as bad as the worſt. Her <hi>Cupid</hi> inſpired not the Lady, but the Lady inſtructed <hi>Cupid.</hi> Here he learned all the miſchiefs he hath ſince been guilty of, to forſwear and betray, whereas before he was very honeſt, and ſpoke not but from his heart; he then became ſo proud and fantaſtical, it was afterwards im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to govern him any longer. He would no more be pacified with Sugar-Plums or Ginger Bread, but muſt have Ragouſts and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:108350:66"/> Partridges: They no longer preſented him Whiſtles or Rattles, he muſt have Boxes of Diamonds and Cup-boards of Plate. In a word, nothing was more corrupt, and this Houſe became a dangerous Shelf to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Fortunes of all that approached it. In the mean time, by means of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes <hi>Poliphile</hi> made uſe of to conceal her Game, ſhe paſſed for a Perſon of Honour, yet exerciſed all manner of Excations and Tyrannies. This laſted a while, and new Cullies ſtill appearing on the Stage, how could ſhe ever think the time tedious, or want new diverſions. Amongſt the reſt, Balls and Dancings eſpecially pleaſed <hi>Poliphile,</hi> yet not more than they now adayes all Women, whom they ſo tranſport, that we may juſtly ſay if the Harp once freed ſome from evil ſpirits, the Fiddle now poſſeſſes many with them. At laſt ſhe engaged her ſelf ſo far, that notwithſtanding her inconſtancy, ſhe loſt her liberty, and became deſperately in love with a Dancing-Maſter. The Deformity and abject Meen of this Fellow, might in all probability have taken away the delight ſhe had to ſee him move his Legs ſo dexterouſly; he yet got poſſeſsion of her heart, whileſt many Perſons that excelled him in Wit, Meen, adn Quality, were amuſed with chat and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſignificant favors. Love was ſo enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at this injuſtice, that he ſearched his Quiver for one of his poiſoned Arrows, with which of old he made his Metamorphoſis,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108350:67"/> and with it ſtruck <hi>Poliphile's</hi> dear Fidler, the nimbleneſs of his feet could not ſave him, and from a Dancing-Maſter he was turned into a Baboon, retaining ſtill all the activity and all the deformity. This Babbon fell afterwards into the hands of a Jugler, that called him <hi>Fagotin,</hi> and infinitely amazed Coxcombs to ſee hi dance on the Ropes; for they could not imagint his had been his Trade, nor that he had been a Man, a Lover, a Fidler, and a Dancing Maſter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>After this trick Love thought himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe with his Miſtriſs, and left her like the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without taking leave; being well clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, he was not long without a new ſervice. <hi>Poleone</hi> liked him, eſpecially becauſe his Clothes were new, and would coſt her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on that accompt in a good while. He was willing to ſerve her though ſhe was but a Semſtriſs, becauſe of her City gravity, which ſeemed very remote from the vanity that had ſo often diſguſted him. This Womans exquiſite beauty made amends for the ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remarkable in her Face, and covered over her groſs ignorance in all things but prizing and ſelling her Ware; Love alſo a while for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got he had been a Page and Lackey, and borrowing a little the humor of an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, lived very quietly: but ſoon after he took again thoſe Arms he knew ſo well how to handle, and made many wounds in the hearts of ſuch as his Miſtriſes Beauty attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her Shop. It was to little purpoſe for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108350:67"/> theſe Gallants to accoſt her with Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to all which ſhe was deaf, or rather the dulneſs of her wit prevented her Anſwer; yet <hi>Cupid</hi> ſpared her not, but could never pierce her Heart whileſt he uſed Arrows headed with Steel. One day when a ſolemn Maſs was intended, he found ſome provided for it that were headed with Silver; theſe had a miraculous effect on her heart, that was impenetrable to all others: and at once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured up in her the Paſſions of Love and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, though probably the laſt predomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, and was only re-kindled to ſerve the other: for though it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that <hi>Poleone</hi> was amorous, it cannot be added of <hi>Celadon, Hilas,</hi> or <hi>Silvander,</hi> but of Mankind in general: Then it was that many Cuſtomers bought the Semſtreſs with the Linnen, and this was the firſt Arrow that had the good ſucceſs to joyn profit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Cupid</hi> deſirous to imitate his Miſtriſs, as Children ape Men, had quickly the like inclinations; he that had never fingered money, but to purcaſe ſome ſlight toyes, had his Eyes now ever fixed on the Counter, and was much more pleaſed with the ſight of Gold than Silver, and hearing his Miſtriſs complain that ſhe was often cozened, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving clipped or falſe Money, learned by her example to weigh and examine the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and to this purpoſe disfurniſhed his Quiver of half his Arrows, to make place for a pair of Gold Weights, a Chamber-Maid
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108350:68"/> of his acquaintance having let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that they which mediate ought to ſhare in the profit; at laſt he became ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, he would uſe no Arrows but ſuch as were headed with Gold or Silver; and with theſe he never miſſed the Mark.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thus Mercenary Love is become ſo much infaſhion, that from the Lady to the Milk-Maid money takes place, and the Proverb that was firſt invented for the <hi>Switzers,</hi> may be better applied here, <hi>No Money no Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> With this the Great <hi>Solymans</hi> and <hi>Muſtapha's</hi> in Magnificent Alcoves, and on Embroidered Cuſhions now-a-dayes court all manner of Beauties; whileſt ſuch as are rich only in Wit and Perſon, ſtay without, making Addreſſes to the Waiting-Woman or Chamber-Maid, nay ſometiems to the Kitchin-Maid, that they may have their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous repaſts at a reaſonable price. At that time Sonnets, Madrigals, and Letters were cried down like antiquated Coin, and whole Dozens of them ſcarce worth a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decu. This cauſed many to become Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, for formerly with was the price of the heart and affection, whileſt the ignorant with all their Treaſure purchaſed onely the Body, by no other manner of Commerce than is uſual in the Pig-Market; in which too there is this advantage, that the King hath his Officers to take care the Beaſts that are ſold be found and marchantable; which eſtabliſhment is not in the Traffick of Love,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108350:68"/> though it were there a great deal more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: but the vengeance of Heaven hath at length taken upon it to puniſh this diſhoneſt Trade, and <hi>Bacchus</hi> become the grand Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Women, ſince he abandoned <hi>Ariadne</hi> to court the Bottle, hath brought from the <hi>Indies</hi> an Infection to poiſon that curſed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that introduced Mercenary Love. This ſo ſuddenly and furiouſly ſpred it ſelf, that whoever was guilt of this corrupt Love eſcaped not the juſt puniſhment of that Crime. Little <hi>Cupid</hi> had his part, for eating and drinking (as the quality of Servant obliged him) of that which his Miſtriſs had left, he ſucked a little of that Venom, which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees inſinuating into his Veins, covered his Skin with Seabs and Blotches.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Venus</hi> at laſt troubled at his long abſence, reſolved to ſeek him by Sea and Land, and to that purpoſe ſent to her Dove-Houſe, which is her Stable, for two Coach Pigeons, which ſhe cauſed to be harneſſed, and ſo in her Car (the Poets muſt be ſecurity for the verity of this) cut the Air with incredible ſwiftneſs; and at laſt arrived in <hi>Holland:</hi> where ſhe found her Son amongſt a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sect that then began to appear in that Countrey. She ſcarcely knew him, as well becauſe he wanted the Enſigns of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as that he was ſtrangely disfigured. She ran to him, and embracing him with a Mothers tenderneſs, to humor him as ſhe had wont, offered him a Paper of Sweet-Meats;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:108350:69"/> but he laughed at this, and ſhewed her Bags full of Gold and Silver, to let her underſtand the great Treaſure he had amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And indeed one cannot imagine how to wiſh a vaſter fortune, than the Money that paſſes to and fro in the Commerce of Love. Having told her all his Adventures, he could not conceal the unfortunate Condition to which he was reduced; which yet was well enough perceived by her, ſhe having had former experience of ſuch accidents.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>She carried him immediately to <hi>Aeſculapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> whom ſhe earneſtly beſought to cure him; but he durſt not undertake it alone, not with all the exquiſite Medicines of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> the Place from whence the Diſtemper is derived: and was fain to call another Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to his aſſiſtance. <hi>Mercury</hi> at laſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took and recovered him, not without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny torments; by them to revenge himſelf for the often Journeys <hi>Jupiter</hi> had cauſed him to make to his Miſtriſſes on his occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As ſoon as he was well, the Goddeſs brought him home, where ſhe hath held him ſhort, and more exactly obſerved his Comportment. It is true he hat been much reclaimed, ſo that ſince they have no more threatned him with the Rod but <hi>Mercury.</hi> This hath had greater effect with him, than all the admonitions and menaces of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors. Since this he hath had a mortal averſion for all Mercenary Affections, and publickly ſworn by his Bow and Quiver,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108350:69"/> never to interpoſe more, but inſtead of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying his Arrows, entirely withdraw his aſſiſtance, as ſoon as Money and Preſents are made uſe of. He reſerves his favors only for tender and paſſionate Lovers, and thoſe Noble and refined SOuls, that ſolely adore Beauty, Wit, and Vertue, all three the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Heaven: Others that have byaſſed and ſordid deſigns, he abandons to remorſe and torments, refuſing anylonger to own them as Subjects of his Empire.</q>

               <p>THis as ſoon as read, had a general applauſe, <hi>Charoſelles</hi> only diſſenting; who thought nothing good but what he writh himſelf: though hemight probably have been ſeconded by <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita,</hi> who never failed of cenſuring right or wrong: but perceiving that the examination of this Piece, if he were once engaged, might laſt and hinder the deſign he had to read another of his own, he deſired <hi>Angelica</hi> to lend him thoſe ſheets to take a copy of them. His deſign was to have them printed, and cauſe ſome of his own, which he would add, to paſs by being countenanced by them. <hi>Angelica</hi> told him ſhe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:108350:70"/> durſt not take that liberty, becauſe the Piece was not hers. <hi>I will give you one of mine for it,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Charoſelles) which I will inſtantly read, as I promiſed.</hi> This word having cauſed <hi>Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> to tremble, he aroſe to take his leave; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> roſe alſo to pay him ſome civilities, and the reſt of the Company did the like; which made <hi>Charoſelles</hi> mad to ſee himſelf ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: for it was late, and no poſſibility of perſwading any body to ſit down again. Some little diſcourſe paſſed ſtanding and apart, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially between <hi>Javota</hi> and <hi>Pancrace,</hi> who from that time devoted himſelf intirely to her ſervice; his Love not being very Platonick, his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for her Beauty, freed him from all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt the coming ſhort of her wit might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him.</p>
               <p>He made her many Complements and high Expreſſions, and ſhe ſmiled at them all, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered none, till he aſſured her with a great Oath that he was her ſervant, and beſought her to believe it. She replied very innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>God Sir, Say not ſo; there are but two perſons in the world that ever told me that, and for thoſe I have a mortal averſion and hatred; you are too handſome to do like them. How then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>have you had ſome ſervants that have come ſhort in their reſpects, by a too confident declaring their love? No indeed Sir</hi> (ſaid <hi>Javo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta) they declared it only to my Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe promiſes to marry me each of them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured they had obtained: What they have done to me, I know not, but I cannot abide them.</hi>

               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:108350:70"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>If you have hitherto had ſervants that ſo much diſpleaſed you</hi> (ſaid the Gentleman) <hi>it follows not that all others are like them; ſince they are not worthy of you, ſeek ſuch as are more accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I will not have any ſervants,</hi> ſaid <hi>Javota, neither if I had any, did I know what to ſay to them, nor what to do with them. Is it</hi> (ſaid <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crace) because it is impoſſible to find occaſions of ſerving you? No,</hi> ſaid <hi>Javota, and you if you pleaſed might do me a kindneſs; but I dare not name it, for fear you ſhould deny me. How Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> ſaid he, (raiſing his voice a little) <hi>can there be any thing too difficult for me to accompliſh for your ſake? It is not very difficult</hi> (anſwered <hi>Javota) and if you will promiſe me to do it, I will tell it you. I do not only promiſe it</hi> (replied <hi>Pancrace</hi> very ſuddenly) <hi>but ſwear it to you by all that is deareſt to me in the world; nay I wiſh it difficulty, that its performance may give you the certainer proof of the paſſion I have for your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Since you thus aſſure me</hi> (ſaid <hi>Javota) I must confeſs that having latelyheard you ſpeak ſuch excellent things, when you diſcourſed with the Ladies, I would beg of you to lend me the Book you learned them in; for I am aſhamed of ſaying nothing, yet know not what to ſay: Would to God I could get the receipt that helps thoſe Ladies to talk ſo well; if I could find their Book, I would con it, till I talked faſter than they. Pancrace</hi> was amazed at her extream ſimplicity, and told her, <hi>There was no one Book that contained all that was neceſſary to converſation, where every one diſcourſed according to the Subject that preſented
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108350:71"/> it ſelf, and the conceptions that came into their heads. I thought,</hi> ſaid <hi>Javota, you would make a ſecret of it, as if I knew not the contrary: when my Mother ſpeaks of Mrs</hi> Philopotte, <hi>who hath talked ſo much to day, ſhe ſays ſhe hat ever a Book in her hand, is as learned as a Doctor, but knows not how to take one ſtitch with her Needle, that</hi> I <hi>ſhold be ſure not to imitate her, and that a young man that wanted a Wife, if he would be adviſed by her, ſhold ſeck another: but let her ſay what ſhe pleaſes, could I come at her Book,</hi> I <hi>would get it all by heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pancrace</hi> perceiving her inclination for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that ſhe had till then been brought up in perfect ignorance, thought he had lit on an excellent occaſion to do her ſervice, by ſending her ſome Books; he therefore began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her, and in ſome ſort to grant that may things ſpoken in converſation, are taken out of Books, though not word for word: that they open the fancy, and enrich it with Idea's, from whence diſcourſe is derived, and he promiſed to ſend her ſome that very night; beleeching her to believe that his moſt violent paſſion was to do her ſervice. As this Proteſtation ended, <hi>Lorenca,</hi> who had brought <hi>Javota</hi> thither, came to tell her it wa time to go home, where ſhe was by that time expected; ſo that with a very low Courtſie ſhe took leave of the Company; who having a while diſcourſed of her Beauty and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, at laſt parted.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:108350:71"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Javota</hi> coming home, could not forbear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing her ſatisfaction to have been ſo good Company, and to have ſeen ſomething of the world, ſhe ordered an old ſervant that had been her Nurſe, and conſequently was one ſhe put confidence in, to receive the Books when they came, and hide them under her Bed, leſt they might be found in her Trunck, which her Mother often viſited. The Books came quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, and they were the Five Tomes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea;</hi> ſhe ran immediately to her Chamber, and ſhut her ſelf up there, and fell a reading night and day, ſo earneſtly, ſhe neglected her Meat and Drink, and when ſhe was ſpoken to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her ordinary work, ſhe pretended her ſelf ſick; that ſhe had not cloſed her eyes all night: and indeed they ſeemed heavy, which was probably the effect of her continual read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She profited much in little time, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very pleaſant happened to her.</p>
               <p>As it is natural to us at mentioning ſome body we do not know, though the perſon be fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, to frame in our thoughts an accidental Idea, that hath a reſemblance of ſome of our acquaintance; ſo <hi>Javota,</hi> contemplating <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who was the Hero of her Romance, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied him to be of the ſame ſhape and juſt ſuch another as <hi>Pancrace,</hi> whom ſhe liked much better than any of her other acquaintance; and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> being deſcribed perfectly fair, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thought her ſelf like her; for this is a point in which the diſcreeteſt Women may flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves. All that <hi>Ceiadon</hi> ſaid to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:108350:72"/> was therefore taken as if <hi>Pancrace</hi> had ſpoken it to her, and all that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſaid to <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhe imagined ſhe ſaid to <hi>Pancrace.</hi> Was he not very happy to have ſo brave an interceder (without his knowledge) to court for him in his abſence; and whoſe addreſſes were ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, that <hi>Javota</hi> inſenſibly took in the poiſon, that made her deſperately in love with him. To ſpeak ſeriouſly, this accident ought not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear too improbable; for Maids of ſtrict and private Education, at their firſt coming into the world, and the company of men, are apt to take fire at the firſt propoſal of love that is made them by one that is handſom: for the two Sexes being formed each for other, their inclinations to each other are very attractive: not unlike a Spring, when wound up, being in a forced po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, returns with greater vigor, when it finds liberty. The ſhould therefore be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with much moderation, and allowed ſome freedom, whileſt the reſpect of an over-looking eye inſpires modeſty and baniſhes licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>It is no otherwiſe with reading, if a Maid that is curious be forbidden it, ſhe will fall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upon it, and her danger be much the greater, becauſe making uſe of Books without choice and judgement, ſhe may lite on ſome that will immediately corrupt her: amongſt ſuch I cannot but reckon <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for the more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally he expreſſes the paſsions of love, the ore powerfully they inſinuate into young hearts, and with them an imperceptible poiſon, that ſeiſes
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:108350:72"/> the Vitals before any Antidote can be received. Neitehr is it like thoſe other Romances that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain only the Loves of Princes and Potentates, which bearing no proportion with ordinary peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, never move them, nor raiſe in them any deſire of imitation.</p>
               <p>It is not ſtrange that <hi>Javota</hi> (brought up in obſcurity, without any reading to faſhion her thoughts or acquaint them with the Paſſions of Love) fell on this Precipice, on which all others that are educated like her, will alſo fall. No occaſion could oblige her to lay aſide her Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, unleſs a Viſit to <hi>Angelica.</hi> She ſought all occaſions of this, and begged of her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to call her as they went by, and get leave for her of her Mother. <hi>Pancrace</hi> was alſo very frequently there, becauſe he could no where elſe get a ſight of his Miſtriſs. He admired at the progreſſion ſhe had made in a few dayes reading, and at the improvement of her wit.</p>
               <p>She was no longer ſilent, but began to take her ſhare of the Converſation, and to make appear that her ſimplicity, was not an effect of incapacity, but of want of Education and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the World.</p>
               <p>He wondered yet more, that the work he had begun, went ſo well forward, when he found that he had a place in her heart; for though ſhe faſhioned her ſelf on <hi>Astrea</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, and imitated all ehr actions and diſcourſes, nay deſigned to be as rigorous to <hi>Pancrace,</hi> as that Shepherdeſs was to <hi>Celadon;</hi> ſhe never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſ
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:108350:73"/> came ſhort in experience and addreſto conceal her thought, ſo that <hi>Pancrace</hi> eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them, and to comply with her accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Stile of her Romance acted very well the part of an unfortunate Lover, complaining of her cruelty, with all the tranſports and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the moſt paſſionate languiſhers; which was very pleaſing to <hi>Javota,</hi> deſirous to be courted in manner and form according to the Book that had charmed her. As ſoon as he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered where ſhe lay open, he drew great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages from it. He himſelf began once again to read over <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and ſo well ſtudied it, that he admirably perſonated <hi>Celadon,</hi> and took that Name upon him, ſeeing it was acceptable to his Miſtriſs; ſhe in like manner taking that of <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> In a word, they ſo well imitated that Hiſtory, it ſeemed they had a mind to act it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again, at leaſt if it was ever acted, <hi>The Adventure of Alexis</hi> excepted, which they could not act. <hi>Pancrace</hi> ſent her other Romances, which ſhe read no leſs greedily night and day, and made ſo good uſe of her time, that ſhe quickly became one of the nimbleſt Cacklers of the Pariſh.</p>
               <p>Her Father and Mother obſerved well this change in her manner of life, and admired at her improvement by frequenting company. It ſeemed to them ſhe grew too knowing, and they lamented her as little better than undone, and for fear ſhe ſhould grow worſe, reſolved to marry her at <hi>Shrovetide.</hi> All their preſent trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was to weigh well the two parties they had
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:108350:73"/> on their hands. They had engaged with the firſt, but the ſecond as I have told you, was much more advantageous.

               <p>
                  <hi>Vollichou</hi> took <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to be either very deboiſt or very prodigal, becauſe he made his peace with <hi>Lucrece</hi> at ſo dear a rate, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the occaſion to be greater than indeed it was. This made him ſwear a breach, of which he gave ſome teſtimonies to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night, who would not give over for all that. He cauſed it to be confirmed by <hi>Javota</hi> her ſelf, who very heartily made him a frank declaration that ſhe would never be his Wife, to which though her friends ſhould compell her, ſhe ſhould never either love or endure him. Then he perceived it was impoſsible to row on; ſince both wind and tide were againſt him; if he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately preſſed forward what could he get but horns? and if he went to law, the iſſue was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>

The day for ſigning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract wai then appointed, friends invited, and what is worſt of all, a Banquet provided. The Articles were conſented to, and immediately ſigned by the future Bridegroom; but when <hi>Javota</hi> was to ſign, her Father that had altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depended on her filial obedience, and had acquainted her with very little of the buſineſs, was ſtrangely ſurpriſed to ſee her refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>

               <p>This Anſwer amazed all the Company, it being little expected from a Maid that had till then lived ſo innocently and in ſo great ſubmiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the will of her Parents; but all this courage derived it ſelf from her love to <hi>Pancrace,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which all Engagements were indifferent to her.</p>

               <p>As ſoon as his tranſport gave him a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, he made his excuſe to the Company and pretended Bridegroom, for the interruption of this Wedding.

At our firſt frequenting the world, we ſoon

It ſhould not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeem ſtrange, if a young Maid that hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes made to her, is unwilling to precipitate any thing in order to ſo conſiderable an Engagement; and patiently wait till her Merit provides her ſome good opportunity. I ſhall rather accuſe my Coſins bad fortune, and manner of his proceeding, not at all, guided by my advice. Inſtead of acting the Lover a few dayes, he would immediately play the Husband. The good graces of a Miſtriſs are to be gained by Viſits and Services, and not entirely due to paternal reſpect and obedience. But above all, if he had perceived in her any averſion for him, he ought to have avoided the ſhame of ſo ſolemn a refuſal.</hi>

They know what is fit for her better than ſhe does her ſelf, and her refuſal is the more ridiculous, becauſe grounded on a fond hope that is very unlikely ever to have effect, to find a Lord that will marry her for merit. A Maid that makes a fortune by her Beauty, is a dangerous example, hundreds will grow old in

Many times ſuch as ſeek to catch ſome Perſon of Quality are caught themſelves, and often with ſorrow, and ſometimes with ſhame, ſee him eſcape they thought faſt in their Net. All things conſidered, what cauſe hath my Niece to complain, ſince ſhe hath been preſented with a Party equal to her, and a rich Husband, of the condition of all her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi>

Now although our Government comes ſhort of the wiſdom of theirs, yet I admire Mrs</hi> Javota <hi>hath not regulated her deſires conformably to it. She is poſſibly in the right, when ſhe judges me unequal to her in merit, and her refuſal ſhall not take off my inclination to render her all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſervice. One Obligation I am ſure I have to her, that ſhe will probably prevent me from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying while I live; for I will here freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that that which hath hitherto given me the greateſt averſion for it, is the many follies one is obliged to in the troubleſome approaches towards it;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108350:78"/> which neither ſuit with my condition nor Genius. My intention was to have married my ſelf after the ſame manner I have ſeen many other honeſt men do, that think it enough to ſee their Mistriſs in ſuch a Pew, or near ſuch a Pillar of a Church, and give her there a dumb Viſit, to ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that ſhe is neither lame nor crooked; neither can this be well pretended to till all Articles of the Contract are agreed on with her Parents: all other ceremonies are meerly uſeleſs. I have ſeen many carried on in ſuch a manner, with ſo good ſucceſs, that I thought this could have had no other; but ſince I have been deceived, I will comfort my ſelf with</hi> Seneca <hi>and</hi> Petrarch, <hi>or Mr</hi> De la Serre, <hi>whom I will expreſly read before I ſleep.</hi>

                  <hi>Let us no longer examine,</hi> ſaid <hi>Vellichou, in what manner Marriages ought to be treated on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it brings the Paternal authority in queſtion, but though I cannot teach my Daughter obedience, let me yet testifie my diſpleaſure, that this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not effected with you; for your Phyſiognomy promiſes good husbandry, and good ſucceſs at the Bar if you can get Clients. I thought to have helped you to practice my ſelf, and to make this appear, I have in my Study ſet aſide the Papers belonging to a Cauſe I intended for you to plead one of theſe Mornings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is an Appeal from a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence given by the Proveſt of</hi> Vaugirard <hi>or his Lieutenant, in which you may ſpout Latine and ſpew Greek;</hi> and thus going on, inſtead of making him complements and excuſes, which were no more than neceſſary to comfort him after the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front he had received, he made a tedious repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108350:78"/> of that Cauſe, with all matter of fact and points of Law, as punctually as if he would have pleaded it himſelf. Whileſt one thus laid the Law, and the other liſtned to him, <hi>Prudentius,</hi> Mrs <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lichou,</hi> and <hi>Lorenca</hi> continued the diſcourſe they had begun, and the other Gueſts in little Cabals did the like in other places of the Hall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what had happened, all to the prejudice of miſerable <hi>Bedou;</hi> and the occaſion of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his and <hi>Vollichou</hi>'s Diſcourſe, was alſo to his prejudice; for a Banquet, or at leaſt part of one, brought from his houſe, then entred. An old Servant Maid that underſtood her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter well, ſeeing the Treaty of Marriage bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, was very diligent to ſend back as much of it as poſſibly ſhe could, ſerving in only what would not keep. The Banquet being ended, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many City Complements, ſome including Complaints, others Repinings, others Excuſes, and others Thanks, the Company parted. As for <hi>John Bedou,</hi> after great variety of thoughts had agitated his Brain, cooled by his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, he reſolved upon the point to render thanks to his good Angel, that had preſerved him from horns, which he naturally apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſpecially in an occaſion where the danger of having them was very imminent; and did not much leſs regret the ſpending his Banquet, than the loſing his Miſtriſs.</p>
               <p>Next morning betimes, as well to puniſh <hi>Javota</hi>'s diſobedience, as to ſeclude her from the world, which they thought was a School of Vanity to her, ſhe was put out to board a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108350:79"/> certain Nuns, that had lately ſettled themſelves in one of the Suburbs of <hi>Paris;</hi> neither was this done without many repriments and reproaches of her fault, mixt with terrible menaces to ſhut her up till ſhe grew wiſer. But alas, this was a ſilly expedient in order to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, this was out of the Frying Pan in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fire, for although thoſe good Siſters live themſelves with all imaginable vertue, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing elſe to ſubſiſt upon, they are fain to receive indifferently all manner of Boarders. All Women that have a mind to go to law with their Husbands, or conceal the irregularity of their lives, or other diſaſters, are received, and in like manner all Maids, whether they would avoid the proſecutions of Gallants, or wait to ſnap ſome of them. Such of them as have experience, and underſtand all the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and windings of the world, inſtruct the young innocents that their ill fate brings thither; who undergo a Noviciate of Gallantry, when it is expected they paſs thorow one of Religion. In a word, in what concerns theſe Boarders, there is no other reformation then that of the Grate, which yet ſignifies nothing to ſuch of them as have liberty to go abroad thrice a Week to look after their affairs; beſides that there are Parlors in this Nunnery every day ſo full of company, that places are ſtill retained in them before-hand, as in the Play-houſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Javota</hi> quickly gave her Lover notice of the place of her impriſonment, and you need not ask if he went thither every day; when he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108350:79"/> went abroad, his Sedan-men never asked which way, for to go thither, became a natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him: he could not have wiſhed a place more to his purpoſe, for here he could ſingly entertain his Miſtriſs, and as long as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; whereas before he ſaw her but ſeldom and that in company, where they were continually interrupted. He had now time enough to give her thanks for the generous act ſhe did for his ſake, and to laugh at the confuſion of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate and ridiculous Rival; whoſe words and actions entertained them long. He had time alſo to let her know, that his paſſion aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented daily, and give her ſuch teſtimonies of it, that never two perſons were more firmly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited. When he was forced to leave her, he left her Books to entertain her amorous fancies, ſo that between the Parlors and that pleaſant Study, ſhe paſſed her time with great content. When her Mother viſited her, ſhe wondred that the place ſhe had confined her to as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and priſon, did not at all alter her, nor inſpire her with ſuch thoughts as ſhe deſired. Seven or eight Moneths being thus paſſed over, (and <hi>Javota</hi> having read all Romances and Books of Gallantry that were in vogue, for ſhe began to be knowing in them, and could not endure bad ones, which would have held her play to eternity.) Idleneſs made her Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſhe began to be ſenſible of her want of liberty; in this humor ſhe writ to her Parents, to deſire them to releaſe her. This they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, conditionally that ſhe ſigned the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108350:80"/> Contract of Marriage with Advocate <hi>Bedou,</hi> who they thought was ſtill at their devotion; but they were out in their reckoning, ſhe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed liberty on thoſe terms, and after many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and ſome kind of menaces, at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, or more truly her paſſion for <hi>Pancrace,</hi> made her condeſcend to his Propoſal of ſtealing her away.</p>
               <p>I do not hold it neceſſary to give you here particularly all his paſſionate expreſsions and arguments to win her to this, no more than the vertuous reſiſtances made by <hi>Javota,</hi> with the Combats between Love and Honour in her Heart: for you are little verſed in Romances, if your memory (be it never ſo bad) retain not twenty or thirty of them. Theſe uſe to be ſo common, that I have known ſome, that to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs how much of a Hiſtory they had read, would ſay, I am at the eighth ſtealing away the Lady, inſtead of I am at the Eighth Tome. Nay Authors that make no more, are to be eſteemed very diſcreet, for ſome bring them in not onely in every Tome, but every Book, at every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion or Tale. The greateſt Orator or Poet in the World, let him be never ſo inventive, can tell you nothing in this kind, that you have not heard a hundred times before. In ſome the Propoſal is only made and refuſed, in others condeſcended to: to them therefore I refer you if you will take the pains to ſeek them out, and I am ſorry for your ſakes that thoſe ſorts of Books have no Indexes, like many others, that are neither ſo big nor ſo often read.

I thought once to have ordered the Stationer to have left here ſome empty ſheets, for the more convenient recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that you make choice of; this would have been ſatisfactory to all manner of perſons: for ſome will blame me for paſsing over matters ſo important, without giving them their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and others ſay that to write a Romance without ſuch Combats of Paſsion, which are the beſt things in them, is as if in the Deſcription of a City one ſhould omit its Palaces and Temples: but another more haſty, and willing to rid a great deal of ground in a little time, will be glad of epitomiſing.</p>
               <p>To return to my ſubject, I freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the reaſon why I have not written the Combat between Love and Honour in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vota</hi>'s Heart, is becauſe I have no particular Memorials of it; it is therefore in your choice to have a good or bad opinion of her. I write no Morals, but a Hiſtory only, and am not obliged to juſtifie her; neither hath ſhe paid me for it, as Hiſtorians, men deſire ſhould be favorable to them, are wont to be paid.</p>
               <p>All that I could learn of it is, that ſhe was eaſily gotten away by help of a Ladder of Cords applied to the Garden Walls which were low; for the good Nuns had lately bought it of a poor Gardener, whoſe Cabages (not ſo hard to be kept by much as Virgins) they well enough ſecured.

This ſerves for ſomething, at leaſt to ſave a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to ſuch as are ſo very exact in making them, of all the places they mention; as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that intend large Volumes, blowing them up as Butchers do their Meat: beſides that, ſuch rancounters give a Connection to the Piece, which without them would be much diſlocated. The truth is, that theſe two Adventurers in Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry made a great friendſhip, and they were my heart and my dear the firſt day, giving each other relations of their Adventures, but not with too great ſincerity.</p>
               <p>But they had no long time to cultivate this, for after <hi>Lucrece</hi> had received two or three Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits at the Grate, by ſuch as publiſhed the truth of her reformation, and being cloiſtered, ſhe privately left the Houſe on pretence of Sickneſs; liberally beſtowing on the Nuns all her firſt Quarters Penſion, which ſhe had advanced that ſhe might have no difference with them. She had a very particular care to make the Portereſs her friend by Preſents, that ſhe might tell all that enquired after her, that ſhe was ſtill in the Cloiſter, and for this had pretences plauſible enough, as that ſhe deſired to avoid the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of many Viſits, to the diſturbance
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108350:81"/> of her devotions, to avoid which ſhe had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned the world. She alſo both by word of mouth and letter beſought all her friends to let her be at quiet in her Cloiſter, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to her mind the vanities ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more eaſie than to oblige godly people to tell lies, if to a pious end; and the poor Portereſs that was very ſilly, had not conſideration to remember that <hi>Lucrece</hi> might have ſecured her ſelf againſt this inconvenience well enough in the Cloiſter, by telling ſuch as enquired after her, ſometimes that ſhe was not well, ſometimes retired, ſometimes praying, ſometimes meditating; but no body being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to dive to the bottom of this buſineſs, all went away miſtruſting nothing.</p>
               <p>When ſhe left this, ſhe went to a retirement of another nature at a Midwives of experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſcretion, who very ſecretly brought her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and undertook to provide for the Child. To conclude, after a full eclipſe of a year and a half, <hi>Lucrece</hi> entred into another Nunnery, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rented and more auſtere than the former. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had been there a few dayes in great priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſhe began by little and litle to diſcover to her neighbors and acquaintance this new Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and pretended to have changed becauſe ſhe had not her health in the other, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the air was bad; ſometimes ſhe very devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added, that there was too great liberty; that ſhe liked not to ſee the Parlors filled with peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all conditions and ſexes; acknowledging
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108350:82"/> that ſhe had ſometimes cauſed her ſelf to be denied, to avoid that diſorder. This ſtrangely edified all that heard her, particularly thoſe that knew her former inclinations for the world. She put on likewiſe a white Vail, and though a Boarder, did all duties of a Nun, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went a kind of Eſſay of a Noviciate, more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere than that which was effectually gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the year of Probation. Her works of ſupererogation and over-ſtretched devotion, gave her ſuddenly ſuch a reputation of Vertue, that all the Nuns admired her at home, and the Governors of the Houſe publiſhed it abroad; ſo as the news came to Mrs <hi>Lorenca,</hi> who frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Nunnery, becauſe an acquaintance of hers had lately taken that Order. After ſhe had well informed her ſelf of the condition of this new Boarder, ſhe thought ſhe would make an excellent Wife for her Coſin <hi>Bedou,</hi> whom ſhe intended to marry at what rate ſoever. For after he had loſt his Miſtriſs, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhame, ſhe had often heard him rail at the impudence of the Maids of theſe times; <hi>Javo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> having diſcovered ſo much, notwithſtanding the ſolitary and ſevere education of her youth: which had cauſed him to take a ſolemn Oath that he would never marry, unleſs he lited on a Wife that came out of ſome ſtrict Nunnery: She therefore propounded to him this new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Vertue, and he was very attentive to her. There ſeemed no other difficulty in the buſineſs, but how to get <hi>Lucrece</hi> out of the Nunnery, and to obtain a thing ſo contrary to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108350:82"/> her manifeſt Vocation to a Religious Life. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renca</hi> ſo ordered matters, that when ſhe went to ſee the Nun of her acquaintance. ſhe prayed her to bring <hi>Lucrece</hi> with her to the Grate.</p>
               <p>At that place <hi>Bedou</hi> was obliged to little Courtſhip, on accompt of which he went very reſolutely; but he thought it enough to be a ſilent Auditor, and was raviſhed with <hi>Lucrece</hi>'s excellent Morals on the Miſeries of this tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory life, and tranſcendencies of a retirement, which ſhe concluded in prayers for ſtrength ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſupport the auſterities of her Order. He neither ſpoke of Love nor Marriage, which he durſt hardly mention to thoſe that lived in the world; yet had a great mind to do both of them: for as her Wit and Beauty ſmote him, her Modeſty and Vertue charmed him: he therfore beſought his Coſin, whom he knew to be dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous, to cauſe it to be motioned; and ſhe could imagine no better way of doing it, than by the Governors of the Houſe. I cannot tell by what pretence or cunning ſhe concerned them in his intereſts, but they wrought very effectually, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſires, yet not without trouble, for <hi>Lucrece</hi> was a long time deaf to all their Propoſals, but ſhe would have been very ſorry, ſhould they have given them over. She ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doubted leaſt theſe were temptations, whereby heaven ſought to try whether ſhe were conſtant in her good deſigns, and then faining an aſſurance in the quality of thoſe that made them, deſired time to pray for inſpiration how to diſpoſe of her ſelf.</p>

She then pretended ſhe would change to ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more remiſs, and gave not over, till it was ſufficiently remonſtrated to her, that it was as acceptable to heaven to live in the world, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing her Husband and bringing up her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vertuouſly; in fine, they reſolved her for Marriage, with no leſs difficulty than a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor is prepared to die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lorenca</hi> quickly ſent her Coſin the News, who immediately laid hold on the occaſion, and was ſo proud to have (as he thought) deboſhed a Nun, that he never conteſted the Articles of Marriage, nor made any great inquiry after her Portion, ſatisfied with the common report of the Cloiſter, that ſhe was very rich; thinking it impoſſible for Religious Perſons to lie or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve raſhly. Beſides this, ſhe was ſo cunning, that ſhe bought all manner of Houſhold-ſtuff for a Family, for which ſhe paid only a third in ready money; eaſily getting credit for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder. In this ſhe very advantageouſly laid out the Two thouſand Crowns ſhe had received of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> which ſeemed a great deal more; and it being a fond Cuſtom, now-a-dayes, to ſpend in Houſhold-ſtuff, Preſents, and Charge of the Wedding, half a Wives Portion, and ſometimes all of it, it was no ſlight bait to catch <hi>Bedou,</hi> that he ſhould ſave that Charge: but that which moſt pleaſed him, was a deſire ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108350:84"/> that the buſineſs might be done without Ceremony, and that his Miſtriſs, to keep out of bad Air, might go no farther than from the Nunnery to the Church, and from thence to her Husbands houſe, who thought he had lited on the Flower of Virginity.

                  <hi>CHarroſelles</hi> would not be counted an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, though it was the only commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quality he had, and that alone made him known in the world. I cannot tell whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience for the faults of his youth, made him take this Title as an injury, but he would paſs for nothing beſides Gentleman, as if theſe two qualities were inconſiſtent: though it was not above ten years ſince his Father died an Attorney, yet from the time he was able to keep a certain thing like a Coach, drawn by two Skeletons of Horſes, and continually cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with duſt or dirt, he had taken on himſelf this quality. His <hi>Pegaſus</hi>'s (for ſo they muſt be called, whileſt they ſerved this Nurſe-Child of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi>) were not at all puffed up by their honour, nor carried their heads any higher than when they drew the Plough in the fertil Plains of <hi>Aubervilliers.</hi> Their Maſter treated them as tenderly as Children of a good Family, never keeping them out late a-nights, nor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108350:86"/> them; nay he almoſt equalized them to <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> they never drawing any but their <hi>Alexander;</hi> for he was almoſt continually alone in his Coach, not that he loved not company, but his Noſe was unſociable: the boldeſt durſt never do an injury to his Noſe, ſo vindicative it was and ready to return. This Noſe (in the mean time) appeared every where, and there were but few places in <hi>Paris,</hi> where it was not known. The Title of Eminence of right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to it, and it ever wore Scarlet; and though probably deſigned for a <hi>Coloſſus,</hi> was beſtowed on a Man but ſhort of Stature, yet Nature had been no Niggard to the little Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for what wanted in height, was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently required in thickneſs; ſo that he had fleſh enough, but caſt in an irregular Mould. His Hair was extreamly unbecoming, and it was queſtionleſs his Head the Poetical Painter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, when he ſaid,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Briſtles inſtead of Hairs ariſe</l>
                  <l>Like ſtands of Pikes ſtiff, pointed, greaſie,</l>
                  <l>To ſeparate which none can deviſe;</l>
                  <l>The Elflock Knots are ſo uneaſie:</l>
                  <l>And Combs unable to paſs through,</l>
                  <l>His Fingers ſtill that office do.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And indeed he never combed it but with his Fingers, which was his uſual poſture in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies. His Skin was grained like Spaniſh Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and its Olive Colour embroidered by Scarlet Buttons, that very frequently pierced it.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108350:86"/> In a word, he had the true meen of a Satyr; his Mouth opened wide, and his Teeth were no leſs ſharp, excellent qualifications for Biting; a fond Laughter was very uſual with him, of which I know not the reaſon, unleſs to ſhew his Teeth, to ſnap at all he met. His goggle Eyes jutted out like Bay Windows, that they might look every way.</p>
               <p>There never was known a Man more envious or il-ſpoken, nothing pleaſed him, and had he been called to Council at the Creation, we ſhould have ſeen things very unlike what they are at preſent. He was the greateſt reformer to the worſe that ever had been known; and continually ſpoiled what he buſied himſelf to mend. There never met any Aſſembly of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous or Illuſtrious Perſons, but he decried it; and the better to diſguiſe his Malice, by way of <hi>Encomium;</hi> like thoſe dangerous Beaſts, that while they fawn, either ſcratch or bite us. The Fame of other Men was inſupportable to him, and whatever they publiſhed that took, torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. Judge then, if in <hi>France,</hi> where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Wits abound, he was not ſufficiently plagued. His Natural Vanity was ſtrangely puffed up by ſome reputation acquired in his youth, by little Works, that had a paſſable Vent; but this was very unlucky to the poor Stationers, who were caught with the Bait: for as ſoon as he forſook the Stile that alone ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his Genius, and began to write ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, he ſet out many Volumes that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read by any but the Corrector of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108350:87"/> Printing-Houſe. Theſe proved ſo fatal to the Stationers, that he broke almoſt the whole Company.</p>
               <p>He preſents all he meets with Catalogues of Books he hath ready for the Preſs, and boaſts of Fifty Manuſcripts he offers to ſet out, if he could find any Printer charitable enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do himſelf for the Publick; but meeting none that will ſacrifice any more Paper to his renown, he hath lit on an admirable invention; which is to write a Satyr againſt ſome known Author or Book that takes, ſuppoſing its novelty or malice will make it ſell; but he lets not the Stationer have it, without adding ſome of his ſerious Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Theſe excellent qualities acquire him good ſtore of enemies, at which he is little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for he hates all Mankind; and no body is ſo ungrateful as not to requite him. Were this a fabulous Hiſtory, I ſhould be very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to fit him with Adventures, for he never made love, but were it a proper phraſe to ſay, made hate, that ſhould be the term by which I would expreſs the employment of his whole life. He never entred into friendſhip with any, but broke immediately, and that which laſted longeſt was with a Maid of an humor very like his own; ſhe was a Serjeants Daughter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in law, and brought forth in contention; born under ſo unfortunate a Planet, ſhe ſpent her whole life in pleading. She had a general averſion for all but her intereſt; the vanity of going fine, ſo natural to her Sex, was one of her averſions. She was very temperate, except
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108350:87"/> when ſhe ate or drank at the charge of others; and her Chaſtity, of which ſhe was eminently poſſeſsed, was Vertue by force, becauſe ſhe could never agree with any body. She had no Concupiſcence but for other Mens Eſtates; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſpeak the truth of her, did ſhe much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy any but thoſe that were litigious: for ſhe had not ſo great ſatisfaction in any thing given her, as in what ſhe conquered at the Pens point. She caſt an envious eye on thoſe infinite Sheets of Paper ſhe ſaw tacked together in the <hi>Six Clerks Office,</hi> and ſometimes asked poor Clients that ſolicited them, if they were to be ſold; as Horſe-Courſers uſe to enquire after Horſes that are rid to watering.</p>
               <p>She was very yellow and lean, with repining at her bad fortune, and a ſecond cauſe of this was the good fortune of others: for her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt delight was to give other people vexation, and ſhe was never ſo much pleaſed with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages ſhe acquired, as with the miſchiefs ſhe did. Her thin and light bulk was very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to ſuch a trotting up and down as was neceſſary to her ſolicitations; for ſhe ridded more ground every day than a Foot-Poſt. Her diligence and activity were admirable, ſhe was earlier than <hi>Aurora,</hi> and apprehended walking a-nights no more than an Hobgolin. Her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs in cajoling Clerks and complementing their Maſters, was rare, as well as her patience, in ſuffering their repulſes and croſs humors, all qualities very neceſſary to the perfection of one that ſolicites. I muſt needs acquaint you with
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108350:88"/> ſome tricks of her youth, which gave fair hopes of what ſhe proved afterwards. Her Mother when ſhe was with-child of her, dreamt ſhe was brought a-bed of a Harpy, and it was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in her countenance there was ſomething of ſuch a Monſter. When ſhe lay in her Cradle, inſtead of a Coral, they gave her her Fathers Ink-Horn with which ſhe was ſtrangely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; rubbing her Gums with the end of it, to eaſe the pain of her Teeth, that then began to come forth. When ſhe grew a little bigger, ſhe made Babies of green Bags, and inſtead of ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, learned to twiſt Parchment for the faſtening together the Sheets of Declarations. Her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Genius for Pettifogging, began more eſpecially to appear when ſhe went to Shool; for ſhe could read Bonds and Bills, how ill ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver written, ſooner than her Pſalter, though printed.</p>
               <p>Theſe excellent Endowments in time render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her the ſcourge of her Neighbours, and as terrible as a Countrey Attorney to Plow-job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. I will paſs by part of her life, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating many famous atchievements that I take not to be to our purpoſe; becauſe before her knowledge of our Heroick Cenſor. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance was made in the buſie Hall, neither could it well have been made any where elſe: there ſhe daily ſolicited, and <hi>Charroſelles</hi> then followed a Suit againſt his Stationer, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a ſeifure of Books, in which he had ſatyrized ſome body that endeavoured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their diſtribution: Nothing is more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:108350:88"/> to Clients than to relate their Caſes to each other, their acquaintance is ſoon made, and they never want matter to hold up the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Collantina</hi> (for that is the Name of the Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Damoſel) firſt of all asked his buſineſs, and <hi>Charoſelles</hi> immediately ſatisfied her, by a long account of his Suit, and when he had done, in requital asked who was her adverſe party? <hi>My adverſe party,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>alas I have a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. How,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>do you plead againſt a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or many perſons concerned in one affair. Nothing leſs,</hi> ſaid Collantina, <hi>but I have all manner of Suits againſt all manner of perſons; that I now come about contains an excellent Point of Law, and deſerves to be well attended to; it coſt me but an hundred Crowns, and I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made it worth me above an hundred Pound.</hi> Theſe laſt words were over-heard by a <hi>Gaſcoign</hi> Gentleman that was near them, who ſwearing a great Oath, cried, <hi>What did you give an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns for a Law Suit? I have two you ſhall have for nothing. That is not to be refuſed,</hi> ſaid the Lady, <hi>however I will follow them for you, and it ſhall go hard if I get not ſomething by them.</hi> And to give Authority to what ſhe had ſaid, ſhe began to tell him ſome of her exploits: She had not advanced far, when the Regiſter came out of his Office; after whom the <hi>Gaſcoign</hi> made haſte, without bidding her farewell: ſhe had alſo done the like, but that her Story intirely took by her thoughts; and taxed not the <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coign</hi> of incivility: for they which ſollicite, are
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:108350:89"/> wont thus abruptly to break off all Complements or Converſations in which they are engaged. <hi>Charroſelles</hi> would likewiſe have followed the Regiſter; but <hi>Collantina</hi> held him by the Cloak, to make him hear out the Story of her Suit; the ſubject of which was pleaſant enough, but the length tedious. Were I one of thoſe that feed on Romances, I mean that live by the Books they write; I had here an excellent occaſion of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the Volume and cheating the Stationer that ſhould buy it by the ſheet. But not having any ſuch deſign, I will ſilently paſs over this converſation, and only tell you that the moſt complaiſant Perſon in the world never gave a patienter Audience than <hi>Charroſelles</hi> at firſt: but when he thought himſelf quit, he found, to his no little aſtoniſhment, that the Lady convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the concluſion of her Suit into a tranſition. <hi>All this,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>is nothing in compariſon of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other I have on a difficult Queſtion of Cuſtom, which I will relate to you, and deſire your opinion. I have already conſulted it with three Advocates, of whom the firſt told me</hi> I, <hi>the ſecond</hi> No, <hi>and the the third,</hi> He would conſider. <hi>I have ſped bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by taking the opinion of ſome ſenſible and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal perſon, as you ſeem to be, than of all thoſe great Quoters of Preſidents and Statutes.</hi> Tickled by this little flattery, he could not avoid to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford as flattering an Audience; yet not without an impatient ſtamping and frequent interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but as a River whoſe courſe hath been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by an Edifice whoſe foundations are laid in the middle of it, as ſoon as rejoyned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:108350:89"/> more impetuous; ſo theſe interruptions augmented the violent torrent of <hi>Collantina</hi>'s words: but at laſt her diſcourſe and her Auditors patience came to an end; neither did ſhe then call to mind the advice ſhe had deſired of him, but made uſe of the ſame Rhetorical Figure as before, to paſs uninterrupted to the recital of another affair. But the higher powers interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and a very dark night came on, ſo that much againſt her will ſhe was forced to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, promiſing to tell the reſt at their next meeting. Her Countenance and Geſture ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently diſcovered her diſſatisfaction, and doubtleſly in her heart ſhe often exclaimed, <hi>O night! Jealous night!</hi> with no leſs vehement imprecations than Lovers uſe againſt <hi>Aurora,</hi> when ſhe raviſhes their Miſtriſſes from between their arms. Her pleaſures therefore ceaſed in order to ſo neceſſary a ſeparation, yet they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not ſome Complements, with promiſes of ſervice and reciprocal ſolicitations in their affairs. <hi>Collantina</hi> being moſt earneſt, deſired of <hi>Charroſelles</hi> a Petition to carry to a Judge, in whom ſhe ſaid ſhe had a great intereſt; he gave it her gladly, offering to do her the like office when occaſion preſented. She took hold of it at that inſtant, and drawing from her Pocket a great bundle of different Petitions, with a Liſt of all the Courts of Juſtice, enquired whether he knew any of the Judges; he asked in what Court her buſineſs depended, ſhe told him in all. <hi>Charoſelles</hi> took the Liſt, and read it by the light of a Candle that was on a Stall, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108350:90"/> marked two who he ſaid were his intimate friends, over whom he had an abſolute power. Two or three others he marked, in whom he ſaid ſome of his acquaintance had great intereſt; making uſe of the ordinary terms of ſuch as promiſe to recommend affairs: <hi>This man is yours, This ſhall be brought about for you, The other I'll anſwer for;</hi> and all with as great aſſurance as if they had the Suffrages of thoſe Magiſtrates in their Pockets: he took therefore all the Petitions to preſent or cauſe them to be preſented; but did neither, no more than many others that undertake them, only to furniſh their Privies, which is no leſs than felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt the Privies of Magiſtrates. But <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſelles</hi> was excuſable in this, in regard he made conſcience of his Vow never to do good to any body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Collantina</hi> was not ſatisfied with all theſe courteous offers, but continuing ſtill in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtile of Pleaders that ſeek recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Judges in a long ſucceſſion of generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even to the tenth degree of Kindred and Alliance, asked <hi>Charroſelles</hi> whether he could give her any addreſs to get acceſs with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. He took again the Liſt, and found many with whom he could do her this good Office; and amongſt others marking one with his Nail, ſaid, <hi>I am acquainted with his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-Clerk, by whoſe means I can recommend your buſineſs to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper-Clerk, and by him to the Maſter. This way of going to work,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>is none of the worſt.</hi> Marking another, he
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:108350:90"/> told her, <hi>My Siſter-in-law was God-Mother to a Child of his Nurſes eldeſt Son, and that way I can preſent a Petition. Neither is this to be neglected,</hi> ſaid <hi>Collantina, Servants have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times greater influence over their Maſters, than their Relations or other Perſons of Quality. But now it comes in my head, are you acquainted with any Huntſman? I have to do with one that is a great Lover of ſport, and Huntſman and Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man are hail fellow well met. I would gladly have ſuch a one mention me to him in the field.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this ſhe named another, of whoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance ſhe ſtood in need. <hi>This man,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is very devout, and if you know any of the bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed Carmelites, you need not doubt; for I have been told that a Friar that belongs to that Cloiſter, abſolutely governs him;</hi> I <hi>know not his Name, but the good Friars are still ready to aſſiſt one another. Alas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Collantina</hi> ſighing, I <hi>have not the leaſt acquaintance in the world amongſt them. But hold a little,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charroſelles,</hi> I <hi>know a recollect Friar about</hi> Lyons, <hi>whom</hi> I <hi>have heard ſay he had a younger Brother in that Cloiſter; he will find out ſome body of that Order, or of another, which imports not, to do your buſineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charroſelles</hi> would then have bidden her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diew, but ſhe kept up cloſe, nominating ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judge, and deſiring the like favor ſhe had done before; <hi>That man,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>pretends to Gallantry, is very civil to the fair Sex, and you need not doubt a favorable Audience, if you go to him accompanied by one that is handſom. Ah, ah,</hi> cried ſhe, I <hi>am acquainted with a Waiting-Gentle-woman,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:108350:91"/> whoſe beauty is cried up thorow the whole Pariſh,</hi> I <hi>am confident ſhe will not refuſe to go along with me; for lately at Chriſtning a Child, ſhe was partner with an Attorneys Clerk</hi> I <hi>ſometimes employ. Charroſelles</hi> again bid her adiew, and ſhe again ſtopped him and ſaid, I <hi>will name but one more, tell me whether you know any of his friends? Many,</hi> replied he, <hi>and that are ſo very intimately. For Gods ſake then name them,</hi> ſaid ſhe. <hi>They are called Guinnees,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and going in company, eaſily obtain whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they pretend to. You are very pleaſant</hi> (ſaid ſhe) I <hi>would not willingly depend on ſuch reports, and malice often exclaims without grounds, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be a Judge ſo juſt, but the Client that is overthrown, will taxe him of having been corrupted either by friends or money; yet ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports are ſeldom true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This raillery was uſeful to <hi>Charroſelles,</hi> who otherwiſe ſhould never have eſcaped Thus at laſt they parted, but not without proteſtations of meeting again; each of them going to grope out their Lodging in the dark, which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to thoſe that ſollicite. <hi>Charroſelles</hi> coming home very weary, ſat down to Supper with his Siſter and Brother-in-law, that was a Doctor of Phyſick, with whom he boarded; and told them part of the adventures of the day, and the diſcourſe he had held with a Maid ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary. All of them admired the humor of thoſe that go to Law, and agreed that ſuch are not a little favored of heaven, as are free from the two great follies of Clients, one of which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:108350:91"/> is the being ſo importunate in ſeeking to make friends to Judges; and the other ſo imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in putting their Caſes, and adviſing about them with all they meet. <hi>For my part,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lambertin</hi> (this was the Name of the Brother-in-law) I <hi>admire why recommendations are ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſought, ſince they ſignifie ſo little; neither do</hi> I <hi>wonder they are ſo much ſlighted, ſince they are often made by perſons very remote. Adde</hi> (ſaid <hi>Charroſelles) that they are made very negligently, and in a manner that ſo clearly diſcovers them to be only formal, they ſignifie no more than Bills paſted on Poſts, to publiſh the Skill and Lodging of ſome Emperick. For ſuch as preſent Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lambertin, they are more pardonable; for theſe giving hints of the affair, may be to ſome purpoſe; but the miſchief is, Judges receive ſo many of them, that to read them all, would be the buſineſs of their whole lives; ſo that ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their deſtiny is to accompany Petitions in the Houſe of Office. That</hi> (ſaid <hi>Charroſelles) is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the cauſe of their good fortune; for if the Judge happen to be coſtive, he may paſs his time in reading them all the while he is in labour: and</hi> I <hi>believe as a Lover would think himſelf very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to know when his Miſtriſs's Smock is over her ears and the love fit upon her; a Client were no leſs ſo, to know the dayes of the Judges conſtipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>cannot deny</hi> (replied <hi>Lambertin) that they which ſeek to inform their Judges of their Caſes, in what manner ſoever, are very excuſable; but they which employ their time to importune a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:108350:92"/> ſtranger with an account of a tedious Law-ſuit; in which he hath no intereſt, cannot he ſo; nay it ſometimes happens, that after all, he that hath liſtned comprehends nothing, not only by reaſon of the intricacy of the buſineſs, but becauſe the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent omits many circumſtances very neceſſary to make it underſtood; for he himſelf having his head full of its notions, imagines others to be as well instructed: but what is worſt of all, the Counſel he demands cannot be to purpoſe, for the ignorant can give no pertinent reſolution; and ſuch as are knowing, will ſee his Writings and Evidences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they determine any thing. Neither are only ſuch as go to Law alone thus frantick, all whom they frequent have a ſpice of it, and cannot avoid falling into the like fault; of which I had lately a pleaſant experience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in an adventure with which</hi> I <hi>will briefly acquaint you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One of the mighty Gown Men once expreſſing an inclination for entering into a near friendſhip with me, earneſtly preſſed me to give him a Viſit, which</hi> I <hi>did one Sunday Morning: as ſoon as he had notice</hi> I <hi>was there, he ſent to deſire me to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a while in his Hall, whileſt in another Room he received the ſolicitations of one of his Friends of Quality. After a long hour he came to me with a great deal of civility, and his firſt Complement was his ſorrow to have made me ſtay ſo long: to excuſe himſelf, he told me he had been engaged with a very great Perſon, that came to recommend to him a buſineſs of much diſcuſſion, and in which were many conſiderable Points of Law: after which he began to repeat it to me with all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108350:92"/> and every particular the Party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned had acquainted him with: in this he ſpent a long hour, and as he concluded the Bell rung to Prayers, and he not having been at Maſs, there was a neceſſity of our ſeparation without farther diſcourſe. Judge now what advantage or ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction either of us received in this Viſit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After Supper, <hi>Charroſelles</hi> being a Man of Letters, went up to his Cloſet, where the firſt thing he did, was to look over his Collection, for he daily writ down all the remarkable Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he heard in company, and afterwards made his advantage of them, by ſeizing them as his own; ſometimes making entire Volumes of them, and otherwhile venting them in other Companies.</p>
               <p>He had reaped that day a plentiful harveſt, which he will without queſtion faſhion into a Hiſtory, and publiſh with the firſt-fruits of his Pen.</p>
               <p>He failed not within a while after to viſit <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantina,</hi> and their ſtrange ſympathy in wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Neighbours, cauſed them to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great friendſhip, I cannot ſay, nor corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, but familiarity as much as you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>At his firſt Viſit, and immediately after his firſt Complement, <hi>Charroſelles</hi> was deſirous to treat her with the productions of his fertil Brain, and ſhew her the Catalogue of his Works; but <hi>Collantina</hi> interrupted him, and would firſt of all ſhew him the Breviates of her Suits.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:108350:93"/>
               <p>After this he pretended to read to her a Satyr againſt Lawyers, in which the miſery of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents was ſet out at large; but ſhe would firſt of all read an Information againſt a pretended Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that bore a Coat of Arms belonged not to him, and for uſurping the quality of Eſquire. Perceiving it in vain to expect a long Audience, he preſented her a Sonnet, which he told her was a Maſter-piece in Poetry. <hi>Now you talk of Maſter-pieces,</hi> replied ſhe, <hi>let me ſhew you a Conveyance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He thought he ſhould have better ſucceſs by producing ſome little <hi>Stanza,</hi> in which he ſaid a Lover made a Declaration to his Miſtriſs. <hi>For Declarations,</hi> cried ſhe, <hi>I have one very well drawn up, and of three hundred Articles not one hath been marked as defective.</hi> Not a jot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced, he very earneſtly beſought her to hear him read an Epiſtle. She inſtantly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſhe underſtood not Latine, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving they were any other Epiſtles than thoſe that are read in Churches before the Goſpels; but <hi>Charroſelles,</hi> that he might be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, told her it was a Letter. <hi>For Letters,</hi> (replied <hi>Collantina) I have of all ſorts, and I will ſhew you ſome in form of Petitions.</hi> When he found it impoſſible to obtain Audience, he drew a printed Book out of his Pocket, that contained a little Novel, which he preſented her, on condition ſhe ſhould read it that night. She would not be ingrateful, and immediately gave him a huge Indenture on the ſame terms. At laſt, I know not whether obliged by night,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108350:93"/> or on ſome other interruption they parted, as I ſuppoſe extreamly ſatisfied to have plagued each other.</p>

He therefore plotted to get her on a ſudden to walk out of Town, reaſoning this within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, reading then ſome of my pieces, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly interrupt me to ſhew me other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, becauſe ſhe will not have them about her: but alas! how weak and deceitful is humane fore-ſight! when he had gotten her into the plain field, ignorant of his deſign, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not likely to have any defenſive arms, he offered to read to her an <hi>Epiſode,</hi> or ſmall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, interwoven in a certain Romance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was as he told her full of intricacies. <hi>Truly,</hi> ſaid <hi>Collantina, it muſt be ſo indeed, if it abound more with them than one of my Bills;</hi> and with that drew from under her Coats a Roll of 55 Sheets of Paper, very cloſely written, and not as in Countries where Clients pay by the Sheet. <hi>I will read it to you,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>before I give it my Attorney, who is to enter it too morrow; I broughs it purpoſely to leave it with him as I go home: you that are a Wit may get advantage by it, for it contains matter enough to make a Romance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since the Law of Nature have ſo ordained, that what is weak muſt give place to what is more ſtrong, it was neceſſary the <hi>Epiſode</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:108350:94"/> ſhould yield to the <hi>Chancery Bill,</hi> as a Pigmy to a Giant; <hi>Charroſelles</hi> therefore was reduced to a neceſſity of hearing her, or rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her to read, and the mean time made this reflexion within himſelf. <hi>Am not I the moſt unfortunate of Mortals, to have ſo often ſweat and waked to compoſe excellent Pieces, and am yet reduced not only to an impoſſibility of preſenting them to the publick, becauſe the accurſed Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners refuſe to print them, but alſo of finding ſome one that hath the civility to hear them read in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; I fear I ſhall at laſt be compelled to do like thoſe unfortunate Lovers, that recite their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures to Woods and Rocks; and after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a venerable</hi> Bede, <hi>preach to a heap of Stones. Did I yet meet the repulſes only of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, that approved nothing but what they write themſelves, it were to be borne more eaſily; but to ſuffer thus from a vulgar perſon, not capable of diſcerning the defects of my Works (could it be ſuppoſed they had any) and from whom I ought to expect the higheſt applauſes: this, this is too far beyond all patience.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Collantina</hi> all this while read on, and often interrupted our diſconſolate Authors ſad Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, puſhing him with her Elbow, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Do you not admire how well my Attorney hath worded this? You ſhall ſee by and by ſomething of the contrary party, and judge how ſhort it comes.</hi> She alſo often asked what he thought of it, and he that had ſworn never to commend any thing, and ought himſelf to be commended that he would not be perjured on this occaſion, in the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108350:94"/> terms of a Pedant, of which he had not a little the humor; told her, <hi>I find nothing in it</hi> niſi verba &amp; voces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Collantina</hi> became a-dry with ſo long read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which with the heat of the weather obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this ſmall Pretender to Gallantry to offer her a Collation, of which ſhe accepted. The Cloth was no ſooner laid, but the Lady began to poize the Bread in her hand; and to find fault that it was not weight, and threaten to have the Baker puniſhed. This difference, with the thrift of him that gave the Treat, cauſed them to fare very ill, but the worſt was when the reckoning came to be paid, <hi>Charroſelles</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every particle with the Hoſte; in this he was very loud, and at laſt ſeconded by <hi>Collantina,</hi> who reſolved to have more than her ſhare in that diſpute: ſhe her ſelf therefore took the Counters, and wrangled on every point, even on thoſe that had been already paſſed by <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſelles.</hi> She ſaid it was not the value of the thing that moved her, but that ſhe would not ſuffer ſuch exactions; and though we muſt believe this to be done by others out of avarice, we may allow it in her only to have pleaſed her ſelf by conteſting. But at laſt <hi>Charroſelles</hi> became liberal by force, got free of this trouble, to the no little diſpleaſure of <hi>Collantina,</hi> to ſee him paſs by ſo excellent an occaſion of a Suit.</p>
               <p>Our poor Author, who got not ſo much as commendations for all his Charges, ſought many other occaſions in his Viſits to <hi>Collantina,</hi> of reading ſomething to her, but ſhe ever ſtood

She ſtruck firſt, and cried out Murther firſt, and though ſhe got the feweſt blows, complained the loudeſt, Poor <hi>Charroſelles</hi> was only on the defenſive, and though he was not at all reſtrained by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Sex (for he had not any either for Sex or Age) the advantage was not on his ſide; for he had not been uſed to cuff but bite. But it was pleaſant above all the reſt, that amongſt the Neighbours that came in to part them, was the Brother of <hi>Collantina,</hi> that had inherited the Office of Serjeant. Though he loved her very
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:108350:96"/> well, he would not concern himſelf to part the Combatants, who embraced each other not a jot amorouſly; but charging thoſe that came in to bear witneſs, began to write what paſſed, and the faſter they fought, the faſter he writ. Our unfortunate Author was at laſt fain to take to his heels, all the Neighbourhood falling upon him, and reducing him to as ſad a condition as a Bird without feathers. When the Serjeant would have ſent for a Conſtable, his Siſter was very angry, bidding him meddle with his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſhe was well enough verſed in Law to underſtand how to undo her adverſary, and that ſhe would reſerve to her ſelf alone the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of beginning and carrying on the action of Battery.</p>
               <p>Going before a Juſtice, ſhe in an inſtant gave in whole Volumes of Informations, and then was moſt evidently made out the ſaying of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Spaniſh Author, <hi>That nothing grows ſo faſt, nor ſo much, as a Crime under the Pen of a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Clerk.</hi> She quickly got a Warrant for his Commitment, and becauſe ſhe had no wounds, rubbed her Armes with Black-lead, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cauſed a Surgeon to lay on a Plaiſter, giving in evidence of certain knotty Contuſions, which obtained two Sentences of Eighty Livres damages each of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charroſelles,</hi> that had nothing in him of a Pleader, but that which ſerved him to inveigh againſt certain Authors, to avoid going to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was fain to abſent himſelf ſome dayes, and lie concealed at a friends houſe in the Countrey;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108350:96"/> where his only conſolation was to diſcharge his Choler upon Paper, and fence with the Arms of his Profeſſion: he therefore wrote a Satyr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Collantina,</hi> and the flowing of his Gall extended to all her Sex. He ſearched his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Places for all that is ſevere to Women, and at laſt formed a Catalogue of all the bad Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ancient times, comparing them to his adverſary, and to her alone imputing all their Crimes. He painted her much more horrible than <hi>Megera, Alecto,</hi> or <hi>Tyſiphon.</hi> But in the higheſt raving of his invective, he called to mind that all would be loſt, becauſe the Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would no more print this Work, than many others of his they had refuſed; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolved, that he might no longer write to no purpoſe, to adviſe with them before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. In this he pretended to imitate many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors the Stationers Penſioners, that eat their Corn in the Blade; I mean, that agree for a Book, when they have nothing of it done but the Title, and the price of it being advanced by them, go to the Tavern and ſpend it, where they alſo compoſe with a flying Pen, and that ſo long, till the Stationers are ſometimes fain to redeem them; the reckoning amounting higher than the price of the Work.</p>
               <p>He writ to all that he knew, ſending them the deſign of the intended Piece; deſiring to know if they would print it: but the Stationers, ſtill ſick of their bad ſucceſs, ſent him word flat and plain, that they would print nothing of his, till he had recompenced their former loſſes;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108350:97"/> this put him in ſuch a rage, that he had torn all he had written, had not his paternal affection prevented <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <l>Thou Soul condemn'd to eternal Pettyfogging,</l>

               <p>Now Reader it is fit for thee to underſtand, that it was written in the Book of Fate, or at leaſt in the obſtinate Brain of <hi>Collantina,</hi> as little ſubject to change, that ſhe ſhould never be married, unleſs to a man that had gotten the better of her in a Law Suit; as <hi>Atalanta</hi> would yield to no Lover that had not firſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run her: and though <hi>Cbarroſelles</hi> had not an entire Victory, yet it happened here as in thoſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:108350:98"/> antient Combats of Knights Errant, which cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed after reciprocal teſtimonies of Courage, without an entire defeat on either ſide; ſo that we ſhall not ſee that averſion which uſually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Law-Suits; this having ſerved to reunite and give them reciprocal eſteem for each other. <hi>Collantina,</hi> eſpecially, who thought her ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible in this manner of Combat, admired the Hero that had held her play, and began to think him worthy of her; but ſee here a Rival or rather another Pleader, comes in to part them.</p>
               <p>I muſt not omit the deſcription of a Perſon ſo extraordinary, He was one that by the ſecret diſpoſal of Providence unknown to men, had obtained a conſiderable Place of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>To let you underſtand his Capacity, know he was born in <hi>Perigort,</hi> a younger Brother (if his word might be taken) of an antient Family, that had admirably ſubſiſted, and cauſed to ſubſiſt very long the Thatched Roof of its Hereditary Cottage.</p>
               <p>Poverty rather than Courage, made him a Soldier, and blind fortune afterwards raiſed him to be a Trooper, and brought him to <hi>Paris,</hi> mounted (as skilful and inquiſitive Naturaliſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us) on a Horſe, but ſuch as conſidered on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his height, making, and ſpirit, took him for a poor Aſs. The firſt Market-day he was ſold to a Gardener for Twenty Crowns, which was very lucky; for elſe worſe than <hi>Saturn</hi> that devours his Children, he muſt have eaten his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:108350:98"/> own Head. The Lackey that followed this Horſe (for Lackey I muſt call him) was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuitable to his height and merit; he was a bearded Pigmy, famous at tripping up heels, and ſticking pins in buttocks, and in a word, malicious enough to have been a Page, had he been born a Gentleman; ever ſuppoſing Gentry neceſſary to thoſe Gallants. His tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was very remarkable, out-doing thoſe that faſt with Bread and Water, for he lived on Water and Acorns. If the Proverb, <hi>Like Man, like Maſter,</hi> be to be juſtified; you may fancy (moſt Courteous Reader, methinks it is a long while ſince I apoſtrophiſed) the Maſter whoſe Character you queſtionleſs expect, I give you, and you ſhall have at leaſt ſome ſlight touches.</p>
               <p>He was as ugly as one would wiſh, if it be ſo that uglineſs can be wiſhed for; but I am not the firſt that hath uſed this manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: His mouth was wide, a ſign he loved to talk to his own Ears, that were likewiſe large, certain teſtimonies of the excellency of his wit; his Teeth were alternatively placed in his Gums, like Battlements on the Walls of an old Caſtle, his Tongue was thick and dry like a Neats-Tongue, and no leſs ſmoked, by the daily va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por of a dozen Pipes of Tobaco; his Eyes were little, dull, and hollow; his Noſe and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head very prominent; his Hair Black and Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; his Beard Red and dry; one of his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders commanded the other, as a Mountain does a little Hill; and his Statute was as ſhort as his
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:108350:99"/> Underſtanding. In a word, his Phyſiognomy had all bad qualities, unleſs to bely him. Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant he muſt needs be ſaid to be from Head to Foot, and this he eſpecially manifeſted by his Heels and Jaws. Ill fortune followed him ſo cloſe in the Army, that in twenty <hi>Campania</hi>'s he got not ſo much as had been left him by his Father (to expreſs leſs is impoſſible) ſo that he was forced to ſeek a ſubſiſtance at <hi>Paris,</hi> that proved his beſt Winter Quarter.</p>
               <p>His mind was very worthy his Body, and though it appeared not in its luſtre, unleſs on the Bench, ſome ſparks of it yet may diſcover his Character. He enquired what the Brazen Horſe on the New Bridge was made of, and they which perceived his ſimplicity, perſwaded him, that Fiſher-men came in the night to ſteal hairs out of its tail to make Lines to angle with. A Friar one day ſpeaking of the Holy Inquiſition, he ſaid, <hi>It was a great miſtake to call it holy, it having no day in the Almanack.</hi> Walking once in the <hi>Thuilleries,</hi> ſome of the Company won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring why that Garden was called ſo, he told them that in former times there had been a King of <hi>France</hi> called <hi>Tuile,</hi> that gave it his Name; was not this to be very knowing in the Hiſtory of his Countrey? Yet I believe he had as much reaſon as that other Etymologiſt, that derived <hi>Salade</hi> from <hi>Saladin.</hi> He was ſo ſkill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in forain Governments, that he uſed to ſay, <hi>The Dog of</hi> Venice <hi>and Sapire of</hi> Perſia, inſtead of the <hi>Doge and Sophie.</hi>

               <p>His Apothegms would be many, were a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction made of them, and might ſerve for a Supplement to the Book of Sieur <hi>Gaulard,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving much of the ſame Genius. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe ridiculous qualities both of Mind and Body, Fortune elevated this Monky to ſit on the Bench, as Mountebanks do by the like Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals to make the People ſport; and he became a Juſtice, which degree, that would have been an honour to another, was the ſhame of <hi>Belaſtre;</hi> for ſo this ridiculous Magiſtrate was called. He acquired his Commiſſion by recommendation of one of quality, to whom he was little known. There is nothing of which great Perſons are ſo prodigal as of recommendations, ſince they can no wayes more eaſily recompence real ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, than by words and complements: but nothing having been here merited, and ſome body informing of the ſmall capacity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, ſufficiently diſcovered by his Physiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, all had been ſpoiled, had he not inveigled a Widdow, who thought it no ſmall honour to marry a Magiſtrate, and was ſo mad for a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhe would have ſought one in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> this Woman alſo engaged her Mother a great Doctreſs, famous for her Intrigues and Poſted Papers. Her Prate more than Skill had acquired her Reputation for curing certain Diſeaſes of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and amongſt others ſhe dreſt or rather cheated a Judges Son, whom her falſe reputation had gotten under her cure. This Judge was very eminent, and had no other weakneſs, but to be too much ſwayed by his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:108350:100"/> Children, by whom he was inſatuated. <hi>Bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre</hi>'s Wife therefore beſought her Mother, the Mother her Patient, the Patient his Father, who thus ſurprized, ſigned a Certificate in favor of <hi>Belaſtre,</hi> without ever reading it: by this he atteſted him to be a Gentleman, and of good life; nay one article ſaid ſomething of his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: after this it was eaſie for him to obtain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Certificates, all men erring by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and as in a Dance following him that leads. After ſo many authentick teſtimonies, he could not chuſe but take, though he became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as famous for ignorance as others have been for knowledge.</p>
               <p>He gave outt, hat providence above had mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly advanced him, and the Parſon of the Pariſh was not wanting to publiſh this in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, deceived by his pretended zeal.</p>
               <p>He ſometimes endeavoured to juſtifie himſelf by the example of a Butcher of <hi>Lions,</hi> choſen Sheriff, who when the Governour of the Town admired how he could perform it, not knowing how to write and read, anſwered, <hi>Well though I cannot read and write, I can ſcore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One teſtimony of his excellent capacity, which he gave before he was made a Juſtice, muſt not be omitted; he was one day walking in the great Hall amongſt Officers of the Army that bought Books, and he, that he might not be ſingular, willing to do the like, asked the Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner for one; who deſired to know what Book he ſought, whether in Folio or Quarto. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtre</hi> ignorant of thoſe terms of Art, had not
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:108350:100"/> known what to have ſaid, had not ſome body pointed to a Volume; he then anſwered he would have a great Book; the Stationer asked, whether of Hiſtory, Philoſophy, or ſome other Science? <hi>Belaſtre</hi> replied, that was not very material, only he had occaſion for a Book. <hi>But</hi> (perſiſted the Stationer) <hi>that you may not lay out your Money in vain, tell me to what purpoſe you would make uſe of it. Belaſtre</hi> preſently replied, <hi>To preſs my Bands.</hi> He underſtood ſo little his place, that one citing the Law of the Twelve Tables, he cried out, <hi>O what good Houſe-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were the Romans!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such was the Genius of this Perſonage, and his very Meen did not a little divert all that knew him; extreamly pleaſed not only in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his Cloaths but comportment. He walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Streets with the ſtate and gravity of a Welſh Judge, and when he was upon the Bench, had uſually his Clerk very near to prompt him. He was a moſt worthy ſubject of ſatyr and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick raillery, but that was not his greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, for he could make a better ſhift againſt the girds of Authors, than againſt the Actions of <hi>Collantina,</hi> who very unluckily for him had a Cauſe determined before him, importing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 10 Groats; in which not obtaining ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe threatned him on the very Bench, and at laſt found out ſomething owing by him to one of her relations. Though ſhe had no intereſt in the affair, ſhe put her ſelf at the head of thoſe that proſecuted him but faintly, becauſe of his Office, with ſo many tricks and devices as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108350:101"/> the poor man, that quickly ſaw two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Sentences given againſt him.</p>
               <p>She was perfect in the skill of ſuch Generals as carry the War into other Countreys, and make their Troops ſubſiſt there; for <hi>Belaſtre</hi>'s Adverſaries and Creditors paid her Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his Friends much more; for ſhe could ſerve on either ſide as readily as Switzers, and her fidelity ſtill ceaſed with her Penſion: but a Suit of five years dependance, made ignorant <hi>Belaſtre</hi> ſo expert, that he became as famous a common Barretter as any in <hi>France,</hi> which Trade he could not fail of learning in <hi>Collanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s School. By often frequenting Attorneys and Advocates, he learned ſome Terms of Law, and by that time he knew a dozen, thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of the whole Intrigue: it happened on this accompt to him, as I have often obſerved it to do to many others; for be it Gentleman or Yeoman that once takes to Law, they find a ſweetneſs in it, that draws them on as long as life or fortune ſupports them: ſo that theſe prove the moſt dangerous adverſaries; whereas they which underſtand the Trade, are the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt to plead; and forwardeſt to agree. He ſometimes got the better of <hi>Collantina,</hi> for like the <hi>Parthians</hi> he fought retiring, which does very well with Defendants, and ſuch as are in poſſeſſion of the thing conteſted; and ſhe was fain to lay down all Charges by advance, which ſhe could not alwayes do, becauſe her Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions failed, though her patience was invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:108350:101"/> Notwithſtanding all animoſities, <hi>Bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre</hi> now and then viſited her, ſome thought in order to an agreement, but they which knew her, knew alſo ſhe was a great enemy to Treaties, and that to ſpeak to her of peace, was to encourage war. He indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the exercice of that Chriſtian Vertue that commands to love our enemies, for though his conſcience reproached him with the unjuſt poſſeſſion of other mens goods, he ſeemed very devout, two contrarieties that have of late very often agreed in one and the ſame ſubject.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Collantina,</hi> had ſhe avoided all Viſits but of her friends, ſhe muſt have lived in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſolitude; ſhe was therefore neceſſitated to receive the little agreeable applications of this adverſary: and fortune, that endeavored all means of making him ridiculous, ſmote him with the love of this perſon, whom he muſt needs have adored without a Rival, had it not been for the obſtinacy of <hi>Charroſelles,</hi> who went on the more zealouſly, not ſo much out of affection, as in ſpight of this new Inamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rado.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not break the Rule I have preſcribed to myſelf, neither to ſteal, nor repeat thoſe things that are found in Romances over and over, though, I report the declaration of love made by <hi>Belaſtre</hi> to <hi>Collantina,</hi> becauſe it is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, neither, in how many Viſits he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain reiterated what he had ſo often told her. <hi>Madam, I come hither in purſuit of your love,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108350:102"/> not to ſeek truce or peace. On the latter account you would not be at all welcome</hi> (Mr. Juſtice) cried Collantina. <hi>But, to make appear to you</hi> (continued Belaſtre) <hi>that I will obey the Scripture, which oblieges us to love our enemies; having no body that is more ſo, than you, I muſt love you more than all others. Good</hi> Mr. Juſtice (replied <hi>Collantina) you ought not to call me your enemy, but adverſe party; and, if you can be contented that we may ever go to Law, we ſhall be ever friends. I muſt acknowledge that ſome ſmall thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge made me begin this Suit, but I continue it only out of a natural affection to Law; and am in ſome ſort obliged to you, for this occaſion of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the Papers I neglected; where I found ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til grounds for a Suit, that hath ſo well improved under my hands. For my part</hi> (ſaid <hi>Belaſtre) I muſt confeſs that this Suit, at firſt, very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me, but now that I have learned the quirks of Law, thanks to you and heaven,</hi> I <hi>am highly pleaſed in it, and find we ſympathzie, our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations being equal. All that I am troubled at, is that my difference is not againſt ſome other perſon, being ſo much inclined to all that pleaſes you, that I would gladly acknowledge a Judgement to you. Have a care of that</hi> (good Mr. Juſtice, ſaid <hi>Collantina</hi> haſtily) <hi>for your beſt way of pleaſing me, is to hold out againſt me to all extremity. We will begin at the loweſt Court, and from thence appeal to higher, till we come to the</hi> Kings-Bench. <hi>I am like Gentlemen that fight, and hold him that acknowledges a Judgement, or that does not plead,</hi> Non eſt factum, <hi>to be as infamous as he that in a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:108350:102"/> Duel begs his life at the firſt ſight of his blood. I confeſs this manner of proceeding is new, and may be ſurprizing, but they which wonder at it, may ſeek its cauſes in fate, that hath endowed me after a very extraordinary manner. Well then</hi> (ſaid <hi>Belastre) ſince I may ſue you without diſpleaſing you, I will bring an Indictment againſt your eyes, that have committed Murther and Rape, and doubt not of their condemnation with all coſts and damages. Now</hi> (replied <hi>Collantina) you ſpeak elegantly of Love, and pleaſe me better than a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Author that often importunes me, and talks out of</hi> Ovids Metamorphoſis. <hi>But tell me,</hi> Mr. Juſtice, <hi>how come you by all this? ſince you are reported to be perfectly ignorant in your Charge.</hi> I <hi>know a great deal more,</hi> ſaid <hi>Belaſtre, for my Commiſſion ſo inſpires me, that my Brother in-law tells me he can hardly know me, and that I have the very Genius of Magiſtracy. This is a word I do not well underſtand, but</hi> I <hi>aſſure you that many times</hi> I <hi>determine buſineſs better than</hi> I <hi>expected; witneſs a Warrant</hi> I <hi>once was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in ſigning, which though point-blank con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what I intended, was confirmed by the Court. Obſerve how heaven ſeconds thoſe it inſpires, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no longer thoſe Calumniators that call me ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.

               <p>An Attorneys Clerk entred, as ſhe ſpake this, whoſe quality being ſo conſiderable to her, that to entertain him, ſhe would have broken off diſcourſe with a King; ſhe quitted <hi>Belaſtre</hi> to careſs and queſtion this little Bag-carrier, Whether he had taken out ſuch an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?

               <p>Having finiſhed this Letter, he looked on the ſtile as admirable, applauding himſelf as if it had been his own compoſition, becauſe he had put in two or three terms of Law, which gave his Clerk hints of drawing it up; and as ſoon as he had written it over fair, ſent it to <hi>Collantina.</hi> I cannot preciſely tell you what impreſſion this made on her thoughts, ſince there was no ſpie to give relation, a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and very extraordinary: for at the reception of ſuch a Letter there ought, according to rule, to have been ſome body that obſerved all words and changes of countenance, moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere teſtimonies of Ladies thoughts; and that diſcover them ſometimes very indiſcreetly. But there happened a greater misfortune, that the Anſwer (for ſhe hath ſince acknowledged that ſhe anſwered) was loſt, becauſe having no Lackey, ſhe put her Letter in one of the Boxes for the receipt of Poſt-Letters, with two-pence, the immediate cauſe of moſt unhappy influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on all Letters that are paid for before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</p>
               <p>If we may yet make conjectures on the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this Letter, the ſtile was very pleaſing to <hi>Collantina,</hi> as extreamly ſutable to her Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius; augmenting her eſteem for <hi>Belaſtre,</hi> and cauſing her to judge him worthy of a more ſmart proſecution, which ſhe indeed performed: for ſhe changed the old Proverb, <hi>That they which love well, correct well;</hi> to, <hi>They which love well, proſecute well. Belaſtre</hi> for his part preſſed on,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:108350:104"/> omitting no occaſion of complementing and courting <hi>Collantina,</hi> I mean without prejudice of his rights and pretences. He ſent her the beſt that was to be had at Bakers and Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, preſents that accrued to the Exercriſe of his Function. He cauſed place to be made for her at the Seſſions and Executions, and at laſt apeing Gallants, who (whethet Poets or not) ſuppoſe they cannot make love without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Verſes, being extreamly addicted to Formalities, would not neglect one that is thought eſſential; but not being ſo fooliſh on the ſudden as to go about to make them on his own head, nor knowing how elſe to come by them, not having right expreſly to command any to make them for him, nor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to buy them; (theſe being Priviledges that belong only to great and wealthy perſons) he found a middle expedient, to take out of ſome printed Book, thoſe he thought fitteſt for his purpoſe, a litttle disfiguring them, that they might paſs for his own more ſecurely; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his theft would be the more diſcoverable, if he made it upon any of thoſe Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are daily read by every body, he was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſeek out the ancienteſt Poets that could be found: Gueſs now by what he judged whether an Author were Ancient or Modern; for he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew the time they lived in, nor yet their Stile or Name: he therefore went to the <hi>New-Bridge,</hi> amongſt the Sellers of Old Books, and there choſe ſuch as he found moſt greaſie and dogs-ear'd; ſuppoſing them of greateſt antiquity.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:108350:105"/>
               <p>There he one day lit on a <hi>Theophile</hi> with all thoſe marks, and bought it at twice what it was worth, thinking he had made an excellent Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and cheated the Stationer. After tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling it up and down, he drew ſome extracts from it, which if they related to love, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther conſideration took to be admirable; ſome of theſe he ſent to <hi>Collantina,</hi> after he had corrected and ordered them at his pleaſure; that is, corrupted and ſpoiled them. He that carried them, was commanded to ſay he ſaw them made on a ſudden, and that <hi>Belastre</hi> had not time to polliſh them.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Collantina</hi> underſtood nothing at all of Poetry, ſhe yet put a high eſteem on thoſe he ſent her; not as good or yet as bad, but becauſe made for her ſake: for ſuch women, be they never ſo fooliſh and ignorant, are more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated by theſe, than Perſons of Quality, that are wont to receive them: ſhe therefore ſhewed them as great rarites to all that viſited her, even from her Attorney to her Laundreſs; but ſhe expected that <hi>Charroſelles</hi> ſhould prove their greateſt admirer. As ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, ſhe ran with them in her hand to meet him (who immediately became pale, as fearing a <hi>Sub-poena</hi>) and ſuddenly cried, <hi>Could you have imagined Verſes ſhould have been made in my commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? look here, though you that make Books never had the wit to write any thing for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charroſelles</hi> muttered between his teeth a kind of Complement it would have been hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher, and received the Papers trembling;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:108350:105"/> apprehending to ſuffer more in reading theſe Verſes, than had they contained Law French in Court-hand. He immediately fore-ſaw it would coſt him commendations, conſtantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by all that preſent their Verſes to be read, and this was to him an inſupportable puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but he came off better cheap, for as ſoon as he caſt his eyes upon them, he diſcovered the theft, and told <hi>Collantina</hi> they were <hi>Theophile</hi>'s, and that they fooled her, that went about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her they were made expreſly for her; and for conviction brought her the printed Book, which <hi>Collantina</hi> received with a great deal of joy; not faling to affront poor <hi>Belaſtre</hi> the next time he came to ſee her: telling him as ſoon as he entred, that ſhe had gotten a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sentence ſhe would produce againſt him. <hi>Belaſtre,</hi> that no more doubted of being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, than if he had robbed amongſt the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes,</hi> thought ſhe ſpoke of her Suit; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he would move for an Appeal: but <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantina</hi> to diſabuſe him, told him ſhe ſpoke of the Verſes he had ſent her; and added, <hi>Truly Sir, you have reaſon to ſay that Verſes coſt no pains, ſince you find them ready made. Belaſtre,</hi> that expected infinite thanks, was ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at this raillery; yet no leſs confident than a Knight of the Poſt, deſperately ſwore he made them expreſly for her. <hi>But what will you lay,</hi> (replied <hi>Collantina) that I do not ſhew you them printed in this Book? All that you pleaſe</hi> (ſaid <hi>Belaſtre</hi>) who obſerving the Book ſhe had in her hand was new bound, never doubted it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:108350:106"/> could be the ſame with his own, which he took to be very old. A Wager having been made for a Collation, the Book was opened in the place of the theft, marked by a great turning down the leaf: which no leſs ſurprized <hi>Belaſtre,</hi> than had his Confeſſion been divulged. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired then the Name of him that could diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great a ſecret, and being told it was his Rival, accuſed him of Magick; he really thought it muſt be either a Witch or Devil, that could diſcover a thing ſo much concealed: for (argued he) either this man hath read all the Books in the world, and can ſay them by heart; or he cannot have ſeen mine, which is the oldeſt that can be found. A little after this ridiculous rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning (common enough among the ignorant) having paid his Wager, he took leave; and to be revenged on his Rival, went to Council to know how to draw up a Bill of Indictment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Conjurer. They told him he muſt firſt of all have a witneſs. <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>where may I find one, I will ſend my Conſtables to fetch him?</hi> This made all that were preſent laugh, but he added in choler, <hi>Why are not Witneſſes Officers, they ſhall do their duty, or I will lay them by the heels?</hi> The laughter was redoubled, and <hi>Belaſtre</hi> perſiſting, ſaid, <hi>Do you think I am ſo ignorant, to believe that in</hi> France, <hi>where the Government is exact, and Officers ſo abundant, I ſhall want ſuch as are neceſſary towards indicting a Conjurer?</hi> but for all his choler, he was fain to defer his revenge to another occaſion.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:108350:106"/>
               <p>That he might for the time to come avoid the like affront, and repair that he had received, he reſolved (coſt what it would) to make ſome Verſes on his own head; which as ſoon as he had once attempted, he thought it impoſſible not to make them; this is a Diſeaſe may very fitly be compared to the Gout or Gravel, of which whoever hath one fit, is never free all the reſt of his life. He was very much troubled to diſcover what were their materials, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving tumbled over many Books, chance brought before him a certain paſſage, where a certain Poet admired how he came to make ſo good Verſes, having never drunk of Hipocrene; the reſemblance of the Name made him take this for Hipocras, and ſent to the Tavern to beſpeak ſome Hipocras to make Verſes with, and was laughed at for his labour; but he added, <hi>If you have none, make it purpoſely for me, and I will pay you though it coſt a Crown a Pint.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, having read that towards making ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Verſes it was neceſſary to be in fury, to tear ones Hairs and bite ones Nails, he practiſed this very exactly. He gnawed his Nails till he fetched Blood, pulled of his Hair till he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt bald, and put himſelf into ſuch a Choler, (for he underſtood no other fury) that his young Clerks became great Sufferers, and long carried the Marks of his Poetical Vein on their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. At laſt he had recourſe to his Head-Clerk, who alſo dabbled in Poetry and made Verſes (wretched ones you may imagine) and a little before had cauſed a Paſtoral of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:108350:107"/> to be acted in his Chamber, on a Stage made of Boards and Barrel Heads, adorned with his Bed Curtains and two pieces of ſtriped Stuff. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This brave Tutor alſo told him there were Rimes Maſculine and Feminine, at which <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtre</hi> exclaimed with admiration do Verſes then ingender like Animals? At laſt after ſome Moneths Apprentiſhip, and ſcribbling as much Paper as a ſcrupulous Maker of Anagrams, he framed three Coplets, not without as much ſweating as one that had played four ſets of ſix at Tennice.</p>
               <p>He had alſo heard that to make good Verſes, one muſt get the favour of the Muſes; to whom all great Poets applied themſelves, and marked four lines of <hi>Virgil,</hi> which his Clerk ſaid were the invocation of the <hi>Aeneids,</hi> and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, recited them ſtill as devout Oraiſons, every time he went to work. Having (as he imagined) ſo good ſucceſs in his deſign, after a hundred applauſes to himſelf (for the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant are ſtill the moſt ſatisfied in their own productions) he went with this Maſter-piece in his Pocket to viſit <hi>Collantina,</hi> where he entred with a ſtrange confidence to efface his late af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front; crying, <hi>I defie you to prove theſe Verſes ſtollen, for all the Books in the World have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing</hi>

                  <hi>Your firſt,</hi> ſaid Charroſelles, <hi>is a kind of a Welſh Rime, which you may mend by being a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bold with the pronunciation of</hi> heart <hi>and</hi> hard; <hi>but one of the next Verſes is too long.

               <p>
                  <hi>Charroſelles</hi> admired all, and was ſtrangely ſurprized, when he perceived the Author, though ſo bad a Poet, was yet better grounded in rime than reaſon; and made more ſoleciſms than limping Verſes. He wondred at his ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and asked whether he had ever made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before. <hi>Belaſtre,</hi> told him many, which he had not had leiſure to write fair. <hi>Charroſelles</hi> ſaid, <hi>This then is but a fragment. Belaſtre</hi> replied, <hi>I know not, but pray tell me how many Verſes go to a fragment?</hi> The laughter at this was greater than ever, which was no ſooner o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, than <hi>Belaſtre</hi> greedy of the reward of his labour, asked what they thought of his Verſes, or (to ſpeak more properly) exacted their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. <hi>Charroſelles</hi> told him, <hi>Truly Sir, your Verſes are on the Greek faſhion, which admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many Poetical Licences, and I take you to be more than a Doctor; for I have ſometimes heard, that a Bachelor is one that learns, and a Doctor that forgets; now, you that have forget all, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomthing
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:108350:109"/> above it. But to return to your Verſes, they are very extraordinary,</hi> I <hi>never ſaw any like them; and</hi> I <hi>doubt not but you will write in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably, if you have often ſuch rhapſodies. Ha,</hi> ſaid Belaſtre, <hi>I would gladly know the Rules of a Rhapſody, is it poſſible that</hi> I <hi>have made one by chance?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Charroſelles</hi> ſmiling at this, inſenſibly took occaſion of declaiming againſt all the Authors he knew; ſo that there was not any good or bad but paſſed under his cenſure, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether he ſpoke to perſons capable of that entertainment. <hi>But</hi> I <hi>will purpoſely omit all,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>for to repeat the detractions of others, is little leſs than detraction.</hi>

               <p>The concluſion was, that <hi>Collantina,</hi> who had long been ſilent, whileſt he talked of theſe Authors, of which ſhe knew not one, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at laſt, whatever came on it, to ſpeak of Verſes, and ſaid, <hi>For my part,</hi> I <hi>think no Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes better than thoſe of the miſery of</hi> Clerks <hi>that write for two pence a ſheet; the conceits are good, and the ſubject very pleaſant. If</hi> Clerks, ſaid Charroſelles, <hi>be as wretched as thoſe Verſes, I pity them; yet they deſerve it not alone, Solicitors deſerve part, and Clients a great deal more; and indeed, all that are concerned in that accurſed My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. Why ſay you ſo,</hi> quoth Collantina, <hi>Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Tradeſmens Sons, that are once admitted into the</hi> Inns-a-Court, <hi>and perhaps maintain themſelves there ſeven year on the ſcore, quicky after poſseſs themſelves of fair Houſes and Land, on which they get Judgments with inconſiderable
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108350:109"/> charges, and all that while live ſplendidly, unleſs prevented by avarice rather than poverty. I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not</hi> (replied Charroſelles) <hi>but their gain is great, but doubt extreamly whether it be honeſt, beſides that, it is a ſad employment to be alwayes poring on Papers of ſo diſpleaſing a ſtile, and to raiſe all ones fortunes on the ruin and blood of poor people. Let thoſe poor people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ok to that</hi> (ſaid Collantina) <hi>why, if poor, do they go to Law, unleſs well grounded? Grounded or not grounded</hi> (repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Charroſelles) <hi>all are alike ruined: witneſs an Emblem I once ſaw of the Law, where he that had loſt his cauſe was ſtark naked, he that won it, had indeed a Coat on, but ſo torn and thred-bare, it might have been taken for a Net; the Councellors and Attorneys had three or four Coats one over an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You are very bold</hi> (ſaid Belaſtre angrily) <hi>thus to cry down our Profeſſion, had I a Conſtable here, I would lay you by the heels. I cry it down</hi> (ſaid Charroſelles) <hi>leſs than Attorneys and Advocates themſelves; becauſe they never plead on their own occaſion, no more than Phyſicians take Phyſick. One of my Friends this very Morning told me that he never had but one Law Suit, of which he got the better with coſts and damages; but he found at laſt by woful experience, that if he had at first abandoned the debt he ſued for, it had been a great deal better for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was his Caſe, A hundred Piſtols were owing him by a bad Debtor, Proprietor of a Houſe worth about Four hundred; he put his Mortgage into an Atterneys hand, who having an Antagoniſt
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:108350:110"/> as very a Knave as himſelf, ſo well bandied the buſineſs between them, that the Suit at laſt coſt Fifty Piſtols more than the Houſe was worth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He made me a particular complaint on his Bill of Charges, which much troubled him, and ſeemed very ridiculous; for one Order was reckoned for five or ſix times: for a Breviate, for Council, for an Aſſignation, for a Copy of it, for preſenting it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which made him imagine himſelf in the Italian Play-houſe, where</hi> Scaramouchio <hi>acting an Host, reckoned firſt for his Capon, then for him that fed it, then for him that cut it, then for him that larded it, for Wood, Fire, Spit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Truly,</hi> ſaid Collantina, <hi>theſe things can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſince it is the ancient Cuſtom that they ſhould be thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charroſelles</hi> then (who had been forced to learn the Art of Pleading to his coſt in his Suit againſt <hi>Collantina</hi>) ſaid, <hi>Will you not therefore grant that pleading is a curſed employment? Since Clients are cuſtomarily expoſed to ſo many cheats? You ought to diſtinguiſh,</hi> ſaid the Lady, <hi>ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as plead out of neceſſity, and are obliged to be Defendants, are usually poor and come a great way off, but with voluntary Pleaders, who attacque out of Gallantry it is not ſo; for theſe are redoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all manner of perſons, and can plague them all, which you cannot but allow me to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pleaſure in the world, and that with a Bill one may do more miſchief than with a Satyr. Their adverſe parties are ſtill fain to redeem themſelves from their vexations with money, or abandoning part of what is conteſted; ſo that how bad ſoever
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:108350:110"/> their cauſe be, if they can but ſpin it out in length, they get by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your ſpeaking of thoſe that take pleaſure in pleading</hi> (interrupted Charroſelles) <hi>puts me in mind of a rancounter I had the other day at the Hall. I met there a Countrey Gentleman that having given a Box on the Ear to an Attorney one of his Neighbours, was terribly proſecuted, and at laſt condemned in great coſts and damages; I heard one of his Countreymen ſay,</hi> Well <hi>Battiſta, ſo it ſeems this Cudgel-Attorney was called,</hi> thou haſt loſt thy Suit. What then, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I can have another when I pleaſe. <hi>The laughter cauſed by this, made ſome enquire the grounds of the Suit, and at laſt grant that nothing was more eaſie than to obtain ſuch Suits; but that it was not the way to grow rich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſpeak not of ſuch kind of Suits</hi> (then ſaid Collantina) <hi>God bleſs us from them, nothing is ſo dangerous as to be Defendant in Criminal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; but I mean ſuch litigious ones as may be bought good cheap of neceſſitous and ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; by this Trade I have long ſubſiſted, and complain not.</hi> I <hi>have already undone by it ſeven good Yeomen and four Families of ſubſtantial Citizens, beſides that, I have three Gentlemen now in my clutches, and doubt not but by divine aſſiſtance to reduce them all to beggery. Collantina</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to relate her exploits as well in groſs as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and had not ſo ſoon given over without <hi>Belaſtre</hi>'s interruption; who ſaid, <hi>Without going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny farther you have given me ſufficient proofs of your skill, and have been long vexations to me on a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:108350:111"/> pretence on which there is not a farthing due. How</hi> (cried <hi>Collantina</hi> in choler) <hi>do you owe me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Have you the impudence to juſtifie this? I ſhall make you ſee the contrary, and refer my ſelf to this Gentleman,</hi> pointing to <hi>Charroſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les:</hi> they then both of them attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the ſeveral Suits they had againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before <hi>Charroſelles;</hi> as if he had been their competent Judge: and both talked at one and the ſame time, pleaded, argued, and conteſted; neither of them giving ear to the other.</p>
               <p>It is very uſual with Clients to make the firſt man they meet their Judge, to plead their Cauſe before him, and take his opinion, yet not definitive; ſo that though I had extended this interpoſed Story a great deal farther, I had done no wrong to probability; but it would have been pleaſant only to the Auditors, and not a jot ſo to the relator. They had ſcarcely agreed who ſhould ſpeak firſt (for this point was long deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) when ſome body knocked at the door, which proved <hi>Belaſtre</hi>'s Clerk; who came to him to <hi>Collantina</hi>'s, knowing he was there, to get him to ſign the Copy of an Inventory he had newly taken; beſides which, he had under his arms a large green Bag of many Papers ſpecified in the Inventory, and depoſited in the Office to ſecure the Fees of the Officers. His arrival made a truce between the two pleading parties, and after a ſhort private Audience of <hi>Belaſtre,</hi> this Clark called <hi>Volaterran,</hi> gave the Inventory to be ſigned by this Venerable Magiſtrate. <hi>Charroſelles</hi> that had an Oar in every bodys
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:108350:111"/> Boat, was curious to ſee it, and ſtooping down on pretence of one of his Gloves, read this Inſcription endorſed upon it, <hi>Mithophilact</hi>'s <hi>Inventory. How,</hi> cried he out, <hi>Is poor</hi> Mitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philacte <hi>dead? he that hath been ſo famous in</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, <hi>as well for his manner of living as his Works? I am confident he hath left many Curioſities behind him. If you have a mind to ſee them,</hi> ſaid the Clerk very civilly (contrary to the Cuſtom of ſuch Cattle) <hi>this Inventory I have drawn up is very exact. You could not do me a greater pleaſure</hi> (ſaid <hi>Charroſelles.) Nor me,</hi> added <hi>Collantina. Belaſtre</hi> was alſo willing to hear read a piece he was to ſign, thinking it might in ſome ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to <hi>Collantina,</hi> ſo that he not only praiſed their curioſity, but by vertue of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Clerk, commanded him to give them ſatisfaction. The Clerk obeying, ſate down, and the reſt of them having done the like, after ſilence made, read as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:108350:112"/> and paſs by the Preamble, with thoſe flouriſhes of Scrivenors, that ſerve for nothing but to waſte Parchment.</hi> The Clerk then took the Will in his hand, and haſtily mumbling over two or three ſheets of formalities, began with a more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible voice to read the following clauſes:</p>
               <p>Imprimis, <hi>For what concerns my Funeral, I leave the care of it to the Landlord of the Houſe where</hi> I <hi>ſhall depart, not doubting but his courteſie would have obliged him to it, though</hi> I <hi>had not made it my requeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Item, <hi>To all poor Authors that ſhall attend my corps, I give and bequeath one printed Copy of a Book written by me, intituled,</hi> The Poets Daily Exerciſe, <hi>in which they ſhall find a moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of conſtancy in ſupporting hunger and miſery, with a moſt zealous Prayer compoſed by me in their behalf; that rich men may have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er compaſſion on their condition than they ever had on mine.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Really,</hi> then ſaid Charroſelles, <hi>I had a great eſteem for poor</hi> Mithophilact, <hi>but I am not pleaſed that he courts theſe ſmall Stationers. It is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known how they ſtand upon their terms, when Copies are offered them. They accept none but thoſe of a certain Cabal they fancy, and theſe at their own price; for though others were thrown at their heads, they would not beſtow the printing them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You have above a hundred times made me this complaint of your Stationers</hi> (ſaid Collantina) <hi>why would you have them print your Books, if they cannot hope to ſell them? Why do you not print them at your own charge, like a certain Author I have heard talk on, that hath a Thouſand pounds worth lying on his hands. Were</hi> I <hi>you, I would rather ſell my Coach and Horſes to purchaſe glory, ſince you are ſo hungry after it; or why do you not rather give over all Baubles of Philoſophical, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick, and Hiſtorick Compoſitions, and write Tenures and Law Caſes; theſe are the Books that ſell, and of which Stationers are no leſs greedy than of</hi> Geneva Bibles. <hi>But, I beſeech you, let us quit this Subject, for I perceive you deſire to reply with a tedious complaint. Since the company hath a curioſity to ſee theſe Papers, let us paſs to Conveyances and Settlements of Land and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which are the conſiderable points of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of theſe things</hi> (ſaid Belaſtre) <hi>we have not found any, only many</hi> Actions for Paſſive Debts, <hi>neither does the reſt of the Inventory contain any thing but Manuſcripts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which one of the heirs required us to put into it; that he might procure
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:108350:114"/> them to be delivered to him: ſince as he ſays, the deceaſed ſo bequeathed them. Theſe are the only things we deſire,</hi> replied Charroſelles, <hi>and theſe I believe are the Legacies to</hi> George Soulas, <hi>you have heard of: I beſeech you let us make haſte to look over this Catalogue.</hi> I <hi>am againſt it,</hi> ſaid Collantina, <hi>and firſt of all require one Article of the Will to be explained, Concerning the Almanack of Dinners left to</hi> Catharinet, <hi>and which it ſays is ſufficient for him to ſubſiſt upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Content</hi> (anſwered Belaſtre) <hi>I will cauſe my Clerk to ſeek it, for I very well remember I put it in the Inventory. I ſhall have much ado to find it now,</hi> replied Volaterran, <hi>for it contains not above five or ſix leaves, and is amongſt a great many other Papers, but I can tell you the ſubſtance of it, having conſidered it very attentively. This Almanack of Dinners is made in form of a Table divided into Columns, and contains a Liſt of all that keep Open Houſes in</hi> Paris; <hi>as alſo of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquaintances of the deceaſed, with whom he uſed to dine. It is divided into Moneths, Weeks, and Dayes, juſt like an Almanack, aſſigning Meals on certain Dayes at the Tables of certain Great Perſons. On</hi> Monday <hi>at ſuch a Lords, on</hi> Tueſday <hi>at ſuch a Biſhops, thus he ſubſiſted the whole year, and in caſe of neceſſity, if all failed, had recourſe to a Gaming Ordinary and munificence of a lucky hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This,</hi> ſaid Charroſelles, <hi>gives us ſufficient light of the whole Piece, and without ſeeing any more I could very well write a Comment on it; for I am afraid it reſembles an Almanack in nothing
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108350:114"/> ſo much as Faſting Dayes, of which</hi> I <hi>belive it contains more than are commnanded by the Church. And in place of the Prognoſticks that are wont to accompany every Moon, I ſuppoſe it fit to write here very often,</hi> Great Famine, Dearth of Friends, Houſe-keeping broke up; <hi>Predictions more infallible than</hi> Lillies. <hi>I conceive he might alſo have compoſed an Hiſtorical Almanack of Feaſts and Weddings, where he had been, and marked all his good and bad dayes in ſuch a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This man</hi> (ſaid Collantina) <hi>was certainly in a moſt wretched condition, ſince he could not live without ſharking, which is in my mind below the meaneſt employment, and unworthy of him that can otherwiſe obtain bread and water. That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is not good,</hi> quoth Charroſelles. <hi>I know Lords and others of plentiful fortunes, that make not the leaſt ſcruple of being habitual Sharks at certain good Tables; and our poor</hi> Mithophilact <hi>often complained of this diſorder: For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>thoſe men, under pretence of capacity or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Legend of Sauces, and exquiſite Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, think it belongs to them as their due to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the beſt Tables, who cannot obtain an opinion of curious and delicate, without their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This ſo far tranſported him and others, that they called ſuch perſons ſacrilegious, for eating up the bread of the poor. I yet hold him excuſable, who went not out of Epicuriſm but neceſſity: for in what other manner can an Author that hath no revenue live? It is to little purpoſe for him to labour night and day at the Stationers mercy,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:108350:115"/> from whom he ſhall ſcarce get water for his hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Once I ſaw poor</hi> Mithophilact <hi>in great trouble, he was quarrelling near the Colledge of</hi> Sorbon <hi>with another Author, who amongſt many injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus ſpeeches, called him,</hi> Glories Almeſman, <hi>which he went up and down begging from foor to door; theſe laſt words were over-heard by one of the Beadles that had order to carry all beggars to</hi> Bridewell; <hi>who with his fellows immediately ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on him, being ragged enough to juſtifie him of that profeſsion: and I had much ado to perſwade them to let him go. But at laſt I effected it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating to them that his Profeſsion of a Poet naturally of it ſelf carried him to</hi> Bridewell, <hi>or at beſt an</hi> Hoſpital, <hi>and that therefore there needed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beadle than his ill fate to convay him. I could tell you very many other pleaſant Stories of him, but my impatience fore-ſeeing this Catalogue of Books, will not permit it.</hi> Then <hi>Volate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="4 letters">

            <p>The novelty of this ſurprized all of them, for the like had not been ſeen poſted in <hi>Paris;</hi> but <hi>Belaſtre</hi> told them, <hi>I was my ſelf firſt of all ſurprized at this, having found a very great Packet of ſuch Affiches when I made the Inventory; which moved me to ask</hi> George Soulas <hi>what the deceaſed intended to do with them; he told me the poor man preſſed by neceſſity, finding his Ware ſold not, intended to ſet one of theſe Bills over his Door, not questioning but many Authors would in imitation of him open Shops of Fame.

                  </gap> this new Trade ought to be incorporated with Tobacco-men and Sellers of Bottle Ale, ſince its Merchandiſe, like theirs, is but Froth
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:108350:124"/> and Smoke. It might indeed be ſo</hi> (ſaid <hi>Bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre) but it muſt then be looked very narrowly after, ſince it deals in a commodity ſometimes ſtrangely ſofiſticated. Collantina</hi> now ſpoke in her turn, and addreſſing her ſelf to <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſelles,</hi> ſaid, <hi>But you do not ſhew me the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per you took up, and which you have ſo long contemplated? Is it not ſome Bond or Bill of Exchange? I think,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charroſelles</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had a while examined it) <hi>you have hit the Nail on the head; it is in effect a Bill of Exchange of Reputation, drawn by</hi> Mithophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact <hi>on a</hi> Florentine <hi>of the Academy of the</hi> Humoriſts: <hi>for he ſends him the work of one of his Friends, deſiring him upon ſight to pay 12 Verſes of approbation for the value received; promiſing to put it to account, and make it good in the ſame</hi> ſpecie. <hi>The ſame</hi> ſpecie (replied Collantina) <hi>is not currant, ſo that though one carried it to the Market, he might ſtarve.</hi> I <hi>confeſs</hi> (replied <hi>Charroſelles) it is much cried down amongſt other light</hi> ſpecie's <hi>condemned to be Bullion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this he let looſe the Reins to his Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but was interrupted by <hi>Belaſtre,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertiſed by his Clerk that there were very conſiderable Interrogatories to be taken by him, was fain to be gone.</p>
            <p>But continuing his Viſits, he often met <hi>Charroſelles,</hi> who that day tarried but little after him.</p>
            <pb n="239" facs="tcp:108350:124"/>
            <p>I ſhould be very tedious, if I made parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deſcriptions of all the Adventures of theſe Amours (I ſtyle them ſo againſt my will, and every man may call them what he pleaſes) for they laſted long and with equal vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor. They abounded with Diſputes, Conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, and Quarrels, inſtead of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements and Correſpondences uſual at ſuch Entertainments. The ſole compliance <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſelles</hi> had for <hi>Colantina,</hi> was to let her put as many Caſes as ſhe pleaſed, conditionally that ſhe would afterwards hear him read a like quantity of Verſes. And to ſpeak truth, he acquitted himſelf very well, and in his turn was not a jot leſs troubleſome.</p>
            <p>I will neither recite the one nor the other, and (God forgive me if I judge amiſs) am of opinion it were more ſufferable to hear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated thoſe Knotty Pleadings, than his wretched Fancies, that ought to be condemned to perpetual oblivion.</p>
            <p>Gueſs now at the remainder of the Hiſtory of theſe three Perſonages, by the pattern I have given you of them; and without holding you any longer in ſuſpence, ſee here in a word the concluſion.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Belaſtre,</hi> his Law-ſuit in proceſs of time ſo undermined him (having to do with an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary craftier than himſelf) that he was not
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:108350:125"/> only made a Beggar (which had been no great matter becauſe he was ſo before he came to <hi>Paris</hi>) but diſpoſſeſt of hs place, the only foundation of his ſubſiſtance. His friends fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing his ruin, to prevent it, ſought to make him and <hi>Collantina</hi> (that preſſed him homeſt) friends.</p>
            <p>They made it ſo evident, that he had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to help himſelf, that they brought him to Propoſals of marrying her, in ſpight of her poverty. But <hi>Collantina</hi> was of ſuch an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, that hopes of accommodation, which in all likelihood ſhould have inclined her to this Marriage, drove her off: for when ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that as ſoon as ſhe was married to <hi>Bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre,</hi> ſhe muſt renounce all her pretences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; ſhe could never conſent nor yield to an unworthy abandoning that Suit, which was her favorite, becauſe moſt intricate. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtre</hi>'s inclination to agreement, was the only cauſe of her final breach with him; and after diſcovery of it, ſhe would never let go her hold, but proſecuted him till intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</p>
            <p>Matters were not alike with <hi>Charroſelles,</hi> no Suit depending between them that could be quaſhed by a Wedding; ſo that he was not in like manner excluded. All their Differences were little Conteſtations that daily hapned by reaſon of their obſtinacy and perverſe humors, which their Marriage was ſo far from dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:108350:125"/> it on the contrary multiplied them to admiration.</p>
            <p>I cannot imagine what moved him to marry, him that ſo often proteſted againſt that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as well as againſt all things elſe that are good, eſpecially with a perſon that had neither Portion, Wit, Beauty, nor any Quality tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Society. He did it certainly to ſpite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to approve that he was in all things contrary to other men; or rather, by a ſecret Decree of Fate, to unite two ſo unſociable perſons, that they might puniſh one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whatever may be of this, the Wedding was propunded and concluded: but alas a day! af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how many Conteſtations? Never did Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of a Treaty of Peace between Princes that were enemies, admit greater debate; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any Alliance of Crowns ſo ſcrupulouſly examined. It being allowable in <hi>France</hi> to the Wife, by a particular Contract, to reſerve to her ſelf ſome part of her Portion, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not common to them both; ſhe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſolicite her Law Suits apart; that her Husband ſhould give her a general Authoriſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this purpoſe, and all profits and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages derivable from them, be only hers. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that ſhe might be divorced and make her Bed apart when ſhe pleaſed, and it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly provided that without this Condition the Marriage ſhould be null. But that which ſeemed moſt pleaſant, is, that other perſons in their Contracts endeavour all may be expreſſed
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:108350:126"/> in clear and intelligible words, with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Clauſes to ſecure them from Debate; but <hi>Collantina</hi> on the contrary crowded hers with obſcure and equivocal terms, nay, with Contradictions, to have firſt the occaſion, and then the pleaſure of Pleading.</p>
            <p>When this Contract was ſigned, you muſt not believe they were yet agreed, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted one another in the Church and before the Parſon, for it had been ſo conſtantly their Cuſtom, when one ſaid <hi>I,</hi> for the other to ſay <hi>No,</hi> they could not here give it over till the Parſon was about to ſend them away: then accidentally they ſaid <hi>I</hi> both together, yet each of them ſuppoſing the other ſaid the contrary. This lucky moment was caught hold on by the Prieſt, who immediately joyned their hands.</p>
            <p>At their coming home, the Feaſt had much of the Adventures of the Centaurs and Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, and the bad Omen extended to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fidlers, who could by no means tune their Inſtruments. The Wedding was ſcarcely fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, ere they went to Law, and on a very conſiderable occaſion.</p>
            <p>As they were dreſſing themſelves the ſecond day, <hi>Collantina</hi> had laid on her Toilet a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Bodkin with a Ruby at the end of it, which <hi>Charroſelles</hi> made uſe of to pick a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Tooth, and in the ſervice broke it: <hi>Collantina</hi> immediately powred out againſt him a whole Volley of injuries and reproaches,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:108350:126"/> amongſt the reſt not forgetting the defect of which his Troth accuſed him. <hi>Charroſelles</hi> very deſirons to hold complaiſant the firſt fout and twenty hours (which was no ſmall diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to him) offered to provide her a fairer; telling her he would cauſe one to be preſented her by a Stationer, that ſhould print ſome of his Works, without giving him any other reward. <hi>Very excellent</hi> (ſaid <hi>Collantina) you refer me to them of whom your ſelf could never get any thing; but though you gave me a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it would not ſatisfie, I muſt have this and no other, it was my Grandmothers, who gave it me, on condition to keep it for her ſake: The fancy I have for it cauſes me to ſuffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable damages.</hi> She then began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ip up his ill husbandry that he would undo her, and had deprived her of her moſt precious Jewel. Which words not paſſing without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite replies and aggravations, the quarrel mounted ſo high, it concluded with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hers to leave him. She then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a Bill of Divorce both of Body and Goods, which ſome aſſure, ſhe had cauſed to be drawn as ſoon as ſhe was contracted, and kept by her to make uſe on at the firſt occaſion. Would I particularize all the Quarrels and Suits that have ſince hapned between them, ten Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes would hardly ſuffice, and I muſt paſs the limits preſcribed to the moſt ſwoln Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
            <pb n="244" facs="tcp:108350:127"/>
            <p>And now, my dear Reader, before I give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I would gladly have thee divine the ſucceſs of theſe Pleaders, and which proved more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate <hi>Charroſelles</hi> or <hi>Collantina;</hi> but perhaps it will be better to free thee from that labour, which I well perceive would be to no purpoſe: and to do ſo, I will tell thee a little Tale.</p>
            <p>Once upon a time, in the Countrey of Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, lived two Creatures that had great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, one of them a Dog Fairy, that had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a gift of catching all the Beaſts he was ſlipt at, the other a Hare Fairy, who, for her part, had a gift, never to be taken by any Dog that purſued her. Chance would ſo have it, that the Dog Fairy was ſlipt at the Hare Fairy; upon this enquiry would be made which gift prevailed, whether the Dog caught the Hare, or the Hare eſcaped the Dog, according to the fate of either of them. The ſolution of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is that they run ſtill. So it is with the Suits of <hi>Collantina</hi> and <hi>Charroſelles,</hi> they have ever pleaded, plead ſtill, and plead will, as long as Heaven ſpares their lives.</p>
